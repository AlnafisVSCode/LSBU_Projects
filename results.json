Despite  \na challenging economic environment,  \nthe Group continued to grow above  \nits markets, delivering strong top and \nbottom line results. The transformation of Unilever to a sustainable growth company is well on track. Unilever\u2019s sustained performance  \nin these difficult markets is testament  \nto the strength and clarity of the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP) and the Compass strategy developed by Paul Polman and his management team.  \nThe USLP is providing the Group with an inspiring and highly differentiated growth model, which is driving performance, energising employees and increasingly being recognised externally as a standard for responsible business. The Boards have been impressed again this year by the ways in which the strategy is being brought to life in different parts of the Group, and the above average results versus our peer group is testimony to this.\nMaintaining good governance\nGood governance is essential for the long-term success of the Group, and  \nI am pleased to introduce our Corporate Governance report on pages 44 to 81, which sets out how Unilever conducts  \nits operations in accordance with internationally accepted principles of good corporate governance. We are very alert  \nto the current environment around the remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors and we remain committed to linking pay to the longer-term objectives  \nof Unilever and, in turn, the longer-term interests of shareholders. We set out more details on our approach in our Directors\u2019 Remuneration Report on pages 62 to 81.\nStrengthening the Boards\nA key role for the Boards is to provide adequately for their succession, and I am very pleased that Laura Cha, Mary Ma and John Rishton have agreed to join us  \nand are being proposed for election at the  \nAGMs in 2013. Unilever continues to appoint directors based on their wide-ranging experience, backgrounds, skills, knowledge and insight, and I am confident that these three directors will further strengthen the diversity of gender and experience already on the Boards and improve it further. Additional information on these directors and the succession planning process undertaken is given in the Corporate Governance report and their biographies will be included in the 2013 AGM Notices which will be available on our website at www.unilever.com/agm  from 2 April 2013. \nSunil Bharti Mittal will not offer himself for re-election at the 2013 AGMs. I would like to thank Sunil for his contribution to Unilever as a Non-Executive Director.\nWe are committed to continuing to improve \ndiversity at Board level and I am pleased that already 25% of Directors on your Boards are women.

        "extracted_text": "4\nUnilever  Annual Report and Accounts 2012CHIEF \nEXECUTIVE OFFICER\u2019S REVIEW\n1  Paul Polman\u2206 \nChief Executive Officer\nUnilever transformation on track\nOur prediction that 2012 would be another \nchallenging year for the global economy turned out to be accurate. We saw continued volatility in the world\u2019s markets resulting in commodity cost rises significantly in excess of expectations. The threat of the world\u2019s largest economy going over a \u2018fiscal cliff\u2019 and the euro crisis added uncertainty and undermined fragile consumer confidence.\nOverall it is a \u2018bi-polar\u2019 economic world \u2013 \none of sluggish growth in most developed markets contrasted by still relatively healthy consumption and growth in emerging markets.\nSimultaneously we are facing challenges \nto the world\u2019s social and environmental equilibrium. Growing issues of inequality and rising levels of unemployment \u2013 especially among young people \u2013 place added strains on social cohesion. But the biggest challenge is the continuing threat to \u2018planetary boundaries\u2019, resulting in extreme weather patterns and growing resource constraints. These have an increasing impact on our business.\nVolatility and uncertainty  \n\u2013 the new normal\nWe remain convinced that businesses  \nthat both address the direct concerns of citizens and the needs of the environment will prosper over the long term. Companies need to show leadership to rebuild citizens\u2019 trust \u2013 currently at an all time low. This thinking lies at the heart of the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP) and our Compass vision of doubling the business while reducing our environmental footprint and increasing our positive social impact. As it becomes embedded, there is growing evidence that it is also accelerating our growth. It certainly contributed to another strong year for Unilever in 2012.\nStrong business performance in 2012\nTurnover increased by 10.5%, taking Unilever through the \u20ac50 billion barrier,  \na significant milestone to becoming an  \n\u20ac80 billion company. We have grown by nearly 30% in just four years. Growth was broad based \u2013 across all our markets and categories \u2013 and high quality, with a good balance of price and volume. Emerging markets continued to be the prime engine, growing for the second consecutive year  \nby more than 11% and now accounting for 55% of total business. \nGrowth was ahead of our markets, with \napproximately 60% of the business gaining share. Personal Care and Home Care showed double digit growth, in line with our strategic priorities. Despite commodity cost increases of over \u20ac1.5 b\nillion, and the heavy investments \nmade in supporting our brands, growth was profitable, with 0.3% improvement  \nin core operating margin to 13.8%.\nHigh impact innovations, rolled out \nglobally at speed, continue to be key growth drivers. With the addition of Magnum and Sunsilk last year, we now have 14 brands with sales of more than  \n\u20ac1 billion a year, and these brands accounted for almost 50% of Unilever\u2019s growth in 2012. We delivered on our  \nwhite space market strategy too. The launch of TRESemm\u00e9 in Brazil last year was one of Unilever\u2019s most successful ever, adding almost \u20ac150 million  \nin turnover.\nWe continue to strengthen our portfolio, \nthanks to strategic acquisitions since 2011 in Personal Care \u2013 including Sara Lee, Alberto Culver and Kalina in Russia \u2013  \nand disposal of several slower-growing businesses, notably in Foods. This combination added over 1% to turnover growth in 2012. \nThe delivery of the Compass strategy  \nand the embedding of the USLP are not \nonly benefiting citizens and communities but also shareholders who have seen a Total Shareholder Return (TSR) of close  \nto 100% over the past four years. \nThe year ahead\nWe expect 2013 and beyond to be as difficult and challenging. We believe this further validates our Compass strategy with the USLP at its heart. Re-establishing trust with citizens and meeting the needs of society will be the keys to ongoing success. Our brands should be a force for good in addressing global challenges \u2013 be it access to water, hygiene and sanitation or sustainable and nutritious food.\nFor example, the Lifebuoy handwashing \ncampaigns target one of the biggest  \nkillers of children under five \u2013 diarrhoea. Domestos is helping improve sanitation  \nin some of the most impoverished parts  \nof the world through a combination of educational programmes and simply the building of toilets. Pureit is bringing safe drinking water to an increasing number  \nof people. Dove is addressing one of the biggest issues facing adolescent girls around the world, self-esteem. Through  \nour sustainable sourcing programmes, \nRainforest Alliance certification of Lipton \ntea and Knorr\u2019s Sustainability Partnership Fund, we are helping to improve the livelihoods of farmers and helping to guarantee future supplies. As our ambitions are high, working in partnership with others is key to delivery.\n41"

For  \nus, sustainability is integral  \nto how we do business. In a world where temperatures are rising, water is scarce, energy is expensive, sanitation is poor in many areas, and food supplies are uncertain and expensive, we have both  \na duty and an opportunity to address these issues in the way we do business.The inputs to the model, like those of all major packaged goods manufacturers, are threefold: brands; people; and operations. These map directly on to our Compass \u2018Winning  \nwith\u2019 pillars \u2013 both continuous improvement and the market place pillars support the operations strand of the model. \nThe differentiator in our business \nmodel is our USLP and the goal \nof sustainable living.The outputs of the model are threefold: sustained growth; lower environmental impact; and positive social impact. These align directly with  \nour Vision statement.\nThe diagram below represents \nour virtuous circle of growth.  \nIt summarises, simply, how we derive profit from the application of our business model.\nA VIRTUOUS CIRCLE OF GROWTHOur brands\nStrong brands and innovation are central to our ambition to double in size. We are investing in brand equity, finding and strengthening the connections between consumers and the products they buy. Where equity is strong, we are leveraging it \u2013 creating efficiencies by focusing on fewer, bigger projects that enhance margins. And we are seeking superior products which consumers will prefer, driving profitable growth. Our operations\nOn any given day 2 billion consumers use our products and we want to reach many more, by developing innovative products that address different consumer needs at different price points. To do this we use our global scale to help deliver sustainable, profitable growth by seeking to add value at  \nevery step in the value chain  \nby enhancing product quality and customer service, and rolling out innovations faster across all markets. Our people\nSustainable, profitable growth can only be achieved with the right people working in an organisation that is fit to win, with a culture in which performance is aligned with values. We are increasingly  \nan agile and diverse business with people motivated by doing good while doing well. We  \nare building capability and leadership among our people and attracting some of the best talent in the market place.  Sustainable living\nFor us, sustainable, equitable growth is the only acceptable business model. Business needs to be a regenerative  \nforce in the system that gives  \nit life. For example, by reducing waste, we create efficiencies and reduce costs, helping  \nto improve margins while reducing risk. Meanwhile, looking at more sustainable ways of developing products, sourcing and manufacturing opens up opportunities for innovation while improving  \nthe livelihoods of our suppliers.  \nProfitable volume growth\nProfitable volume growth is the basis of the virtuous circle of growth. Stronger brands and innovation are the key drivers behind it. Consistently strong volume growth builds brand equity as we reach more consumers, more often.Cost leverage + efficiency\nProfitable volume growth allows  \nus to optimise the utilisation of our infrastructure and spread fixed costs  \nover a larger number of units produced, reducing the average cost per unit.  \nIt improves our profitability and allows  \nus to invest in the business.Innovation + marketing investment\nLower costs and improved efficiency enable us to strengthen our business further. New and improved products  \nare the result of investment in R&D  \nand, together with effective marketing, strengthen our brand equity. This results in profitable volume growth, self-perpetuating the virtuous circle of growth."

By focusing on sustainable  \nliving needs, we can build brands with a significant purpose. By reducing waste, we create efficiencies and reduce costs, which helps to improve our margins. And we havefound that once we start looking at product development, sourcing and manufacturing through a sustainability lens, it opens up great opportunities for innovation. Our Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP) sets out to decouple our growth from our environmental impact, while  \nat the same time increasing our positive social impact. Our USLP has three big goals that by 2020 will enable us to: \n\u2022\tHelp more than a billion people to \nimprove their health and well-being.\n\u2022\tHalve the environmental footprint  \nof our products.\n \u2022\tSource 100% of our agricultural  \nraw materials sustainably and enhance the livelihoods of people across our value chain.Underpinning these goals are seven commitments supported by around 50 targets spanning our social, environmental and economic performance across the value chain \u2013 from the sourcing of raw materials all the way through to the use  \nof our products in the home. \nIn the second year of our USLP, we made \nsteady progress across our commitments.

From  \nbeing unknown in Brazil, TRESemm\u00e9 is now one  \nof the country\u2019s leading hair brands in hypermarkets and drugstore chains.\nTHE FRUITS OF \nGROWTH\nParents buy Kissan ketchups and jams because they are made from fresh fruit and vegetables \u2013 and children eat them because  \nthey taste great. By emphasising the natural ingredients of its products and improving taste and texture, Kissan has established a strong market share position  \nin India.\nWORLD TOILET DAY\nMore than 2 billion people worldwide lack access  \nto clean toilets \u2013 a public health risk which we are campaigning to solve.  \nIn November 2012, our Domestos brand and our partner, the World Toilet Organization, opened  \nthe world\u2019s first \u2018toilet academies\u2019 in Vietnam,  \nthe first stage in a global programme to train local entrepreneurs to set up hygienic toilet businesses.\nOUR BRAN\nDS IN ACTION  TO FIND OUT MORE GO TO  \nWWW.UNILEVER.COM/BRANDS-IN-ACTION .Strong brands and innovation will play central roles in our ambition to double  \nthe size of our business. We are investing heavily in the equity of our brands, seeking to find the connections between consumers and the products they buy, and so to strengthen them. Where  \nwe have strong brand equity, we are leveraging it \u2013 creating efficiencies by focusing on fewer, bigger projects that enhance margins. And we are improving our brands, developing superior products which consumers will prefer, driving profitable growth.Building brand equities\nBuilding brand equities\nThe strength of our business lies in  \nbrands that consumers love to buy and use. \nAs we invest greater and greater effort in understanding consumers\u2019 relationships with our products, we increasingly find  \nthey are looking for brands that make a difference in their lives and to their world. So to make our brands stronger, we want  \nto draw out the ways in which our products resonate with consumers \u2013 and create brands with purpose.\nBrands with purpose\nFew issues could give more purpose to our work than sanitation: over 2,000 children die every day from diarrhoea, which is linked to, among other things, a lack of clean toilets for more than 2 billion people worldwide. Our Domestos brand works with local entrepreneurs in countries where access to sanitation is limited, helping them set up small businesses which source, sell and maintain hygienic toilet facilities. It is one of the many ways  \nin which our Domestos brand is supporting a campaign to improve sanitation for millions of people. In keeping with Unilever tradition, it is doing well by doing good. Overall, Domestos sales grew by more than 9% in 2012.\nUnilever Annual Report and Accounts 2012 49 million\npeople reached by our Brush Day and Night oral care campaign over 2010-2012DOMESTOS IS SUPPORTING \nA CAMPAIGN TO IMPROVE SANITATI\nON FOR MILLIONS \nOF PEOPLE\nSimila\nrly, our Brush Day and Night \ncampaign, which encourages parents  \nand children to adopt good brushing habits, \nconnects our family health oral care brands, led by Signal, to the dental health  \nof millions. Brush Day and Night reached  \n49 million people over 2010-2012 and has helped our Signal brand grow by 22%  \nsince 2008. \nSustainable marketing\nUnderstanding the role of brands  \nin people\u2019s lives also helps us target marketing efforts where they are most meaningful. For example, in South Africa we have offered free Wonderbags to customers of Shoprite stores when  \nthey buy three 200g packs of Unilever\u2019s Rajah curry powder. The Wonderbag  \nis a remarkable advance in sustainable cooking \u2013 an inexpensive heat retention cooker that reduces fuel consumption  \nby half, reduces smoke from cooking  \nfires and helps food retain its taste, nutrition and texture. Run in partnership with Shoprite and Natural Balance (the manufacturers of the Wonderbag), this innovative scheme has helped 400,000 consumers to save significantly on their fuel bills.\n \n  "

Parent to  \nchild, sibling to sibling, neighbour to neighbour \u2013 a good word from a trusted source is a high endorsement for any product. Now, in the digital age, millions  \nof consumers from nearly every geography and demographic are connected in a giant conversation in which the brands they  \nlove play an important part. By creating brands that have meaning and purpose  \nfor consumers, we are harnessing that connectivity \u2013 and enabling consumers  \nto become our brands\u2019 ambassadors. \nPart of the success of our Dove Self \nEsteem Project, which encourages  \nwomen and girls to develop a positive relationship with beauty, has been an increased willingness among consumers to spread the brand\u2019s affirmative message. Research by Millward Brown shows that among women in the US who are aware  \nof the Dove Self Esteem Project, 62% \nwould recommend the Dove brand to others \u2013 that\u2019s 16% more than among those who are not aware of the project.  Leverage bigger brands\nLeverage bigger brands\nOnce we have identified brands with a \nclear purpose in consumers\u2019 lives, we can have the greatest impact by concentrating our efforts on a selected number of key brands and leveraging the benefits of scale. We\u2019re making greater investments in fewer, bigger projects and focusing  \non margin growth.\nMaking a mark with consumers\nBigger marketing campaigns which  \ncan operate through multiple media are achieving what we call \u2018media cut-through\u2019: when a campaign remains memorable despite the many competing claims on consumers\u2019 attention. Our \u2018Dirt is Good\u2019 (DiG) brands, which include Omo and Persil, re-launched in multiple markets in 2012 with a powerful mix of traditional and digital advertising, reassuring parents that their children can learn through healthy, messy play because of our products\u2019 tough stain-removing performance. Five key markets have already grown market share as a result and more DiG re-launches  \nare planned for 2013. Driving down costsNegotiating larger advertising and promotion deals also allows for greater economies of scale, especially where campaigns can be adapted for different regions and countries. Margins can be further increased when bigger projects allow other savings \u2013 for example, in waste.In\nnova ti\nng with ambition\nIn 2012 we took important steps to align R&D within our category organisation.  \nThis allows for an integrated product innovation funnel from idea through  \nto market, informed at every step by consumer benefit and value. Our six  \nmajor laboratories across the world are complemented by a network of regional centres that give us the strength to deliver innovations globally and apply regional variants that consumers value.\nAt the same time as strengthening  \nR&D within our categories, we continue  \nto look to the future through a core group \nof scientific experts. These are charged with uncovering breakthrough scientific developments and providing thought leadership and connections with the external world to fuel our future category R&D programmes further.\nLOWER CALORIE  \nICE CREAM FOR KIDS\nMore at\n: www.unilever.com/heartbrandAs part of the Unilever  \nSustainable Living Plan, we set  \nourselves the target of ensuring  \nthat our children\u2019s ice creams would  \ncontain 110 kilocalories or fewer per  \nserving by the end of 2014. We are introducing \nthe Specially for Kids logo on Max and Paddlepop branded ice creams to reflect  \nour commitment to products which combine  \nfun tastes, textures, shapes and colours, and comply with this target so children can enjoy them as part of a balanced diet and active lifestyle.  By the end of 2012, more than 80%  \nof our children\u2019s ice creams had met our target.\n14 Unilever  Annual Report and Accounts 2012\n"

Already launched through  \na celebrity-backed campaign in Russia, which saw retail sales grow by 26% in  \n12 months, this new technology will be rolled out in another 18 countries in 2013. \nWinning market share\nBig, fast, ambitious projects can have significant results, provided they are attuned to consumer needs. When we launched the TRESemm\u00e9 brand into one  \nof the world\u2019s largest hair markets, Brazil, it became one of the leading hair brands  \nin both hypermarkets and drugstore chains within five months. TRESemm\u00e9 is available in a number of other countries and also includes a range of salon-quality dry shampoos designed to rejuvenate hair without a single drop of water \u2013 good for  \nthe environment as well as helping grow our business. Alongside TRESemm\u00e9\u2019s rapid launch, we introduced more than 80 new  \nor renewed products in Brazil, including two new Dove variants and re-launches  \nof the Seda and Clear ranges, resulting  \nin substantial gains in a vital market.\nWin consumer preference\nBy making superior products with  \nbenefits people appreciate, we  \nincreasingly win consumer preference  \nfor premium brands where added value  \nis greatest. Premiumisation, innovation and differentiation will be essential if  \nwe are to grow faster than our markets. \nSuperiority you can feel\nThe team behind every product in every category of our business is set a clear target for improvement: we want all our brands to be superior to the competition. At present, our global \u2018Product Benchmarking Programme\u2019 shows  \nthat 96% of our products in scope are considered equal to, or better than, our  \nkey competitors\u2019. And where we have  made advances in product performance, we are increasingly able to tell consumers how they will benefit. \nWhen we improved the Sunlight hand \ndishwash brand, for instance, we had thought carefully about the billions of hours spent every day across the world washing dishes, and the benefits that could come from a dishwash that degreases dishes faster and more  \neasily. We made sure our marketing communicated these improvements, with the result that we converted millions of households to Sunlight, doubling turnover for the dishwash brand in six years.\nQuality worth paying for \nAs well as driving volume growth,  \nsuperior products can command premium prices, ensuring that growth is profitable. All around the world, we are offering products for which consumers are willing to trade up, with a corresponding rise in added value. In Russia, for example, we launched the Carte d\u2019Or ice cream range  \nin December 2011. The Carte d\u2019Or products were made to premium recipes and marketed accordingly \u2013 creating additional value per serving. In just over six months, Carte d\u2019Or sales grew profitably to represent some 25% of the premium segment.\nSome\n 25%\nof premium segment in Russia achieved by Carte d\u2019Or in just over six months  \nfrom launch\nIN 2012 WE WERE \nMARKET LEADER  \nIN LIQUID LAUNDRY DETERGENT SALES IN EMERGING MARKETS, WITH MARKET SHARE OF OVER 25%\nLAUNDRY LIQUIDS \u2013 BETTER FOR CONSUMERS, \nCUSTOMERS, BUSINESS AND ENVIRONMENT\nIn 2012 we were market leader in liquid laundry \ndetergent sales in emerging markets, increasing \nour market share by over 10 percentage points since 2010. Consumers are increasingly convinced of the benefits of liquids like Omo  \nand Surf \u2013 which not only offer a better wash experience but, especially when concentrated, create lower greenhouse gas emissions in their manufacture and distribution than powders.And liquids are good for our business \u2013 great performance combined with premium prices and lower material and transport costs, especially for concentrates, mean higher gross margins.\nMore at: www.unilever.com/omo"

How  \ndo we do it? By translating the marketing knowledge  \nand expertise we\u2019ve gained from building our brands into improving the experience for shoppers in-store.  \nA better shopping experience leads to improved sales growth, as shoppers purchase our products more frequently. The programme has led us to develop  \nour understanding of what works in different channels and store formats, and also encouraged us to develop  \na range of new IT systems to facilitate measurement  \nof key parameters, that\u2019s improving the way we do business and helping us stand out from the competition.\nDOVE FLIES INTO  \nTHE PHILIPPINES  \nIn 2012, the Dove hair  \nrange was introduced  \ninto the Philippines  \nas a premium haircare brand. Its launch included post-wash products like conditioners and treatments. Within six months, the Dove hair range had become the number three brand  \nin the market and we achieved our highest  \nshare of the haircare market for a decade.\nWASH THOSE  \nGERMS RIGHT OUT  \nOF MY HANDS\nOn 15 October 2012,  \npeople in 42 countries  \ntook part in Lifebuoy\u2019s  \nfifth Global Handwashing Day. Each year, over  \n200 million people hear about it through the media.  \nWe aim to change the behaviour of 1 billion people across Asia, Africa and Latin America by 2015 and reduce diarrhoea and respiratory disease.\nOUR\n CUS\nTOMERS  TO FIND OUT HOW WE WORK WITH CUSTOMERS SO OUR PRODUCTS REACH \nSHOPPERS GO TO WWW.UNILEVER.COM/SUSTAINABLE-LIVING/CUSTOMERS-SUPPLIERS .There are 2 billion consumers who use our products on any given day and we want to reach many more. We do this  \nby addressing different consumer needs with relevant innovations at different price points, rolling them out fast  \nacross all markets, and increasing the availability and visibility of our products through our growing \u2018Perfect Stores\u2019 programme. At the heart of our \u2018winning in the market place\u2019 strategy is a desire to achieve growth in the most cost-effective and sustainable way. Reaching more consumers\nReaching more consumers\nMarket development is a key driver  \nof our growth and built around the \nfollowing approach: \u2022\treaching up (encouraging more  \naffluent consumers to use our  \npremium brands);\n\u2022\treaching down (offering value products for consumers on lower incomes in emerging and developed markets); and\n\u2022\treaching wide (being first and fast to take our brands into what we call \u2018white spaces\u2019, namely new geographies like Central Africa and Myanmar, emerging consumer segments like male grooming, and new channels like e-commerce).\nPremiumisationBy 2020, 1.8 billion more consumers, mainly from emerging markets, will move up the ladder and become more affluent. Reaching up is therefore a critical growth opportunity for us. \n 5 million\n\u2018Perfect Stores\u2019 across 75 markets\n 119 million \npeople reached with Lifebuoy handwashing programmes since 2010Durin\ng 2012, we continued to focus on \nbuilding our premium portfolio across categories to deliver growth and better margins. For example, in January 2012,  \nwe launched the Dove hair range in the Philippines, and it became the market\u2019s number three brand in just six months. Similarly, in May we launched the Clear brand into the US, the largest haircare market in the world, proof that we can grow through premium brands in developed markets too. \nIt\u2019s not just in Personal Care that we are \ndriving premiumisation. Magnum, our premium ice cream brand, is growing faster than the category average and became a \u20ac1 billion brand in 2012.  \nYou can now buy Magnum in more than  \n40 countries, including the Philippines, Pakistan and Thailand, following the 2012 roll-out of the brand in these countries.\nOffering affordable brands\nThere remain many less affluent consumers in emerging markets who  \ncan benefit from our affordable brands. However, reaching down is not simply about expanding into these markets;  \nit is also about offering affordable products to shoppers struggling in tough economic conditions across Europe and the US. This year, for example, 46 million people in the US used food stamps.\nUnilever Annual Report and Accounts 2012"

Responding swiftly to the economic crisis in Greece,  \nin less than six months from development we launched Elais, a new value-for-money food brand, which offers consumers a  \nhigh quality product range positioned for lower incomes. \nAnd it\u2019s not just new or local brands.  \nIn 1894, William Lever launched an \naffordable soap called Lifebuoy. Today, building on its legacy, the global soap brand is helping to raise hygiene standards in emerging markets through the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP). Lifebuoy has reached 119 million people with handwashing programmes since 2010, while helping the brand experience double digit growth in the  \nlast three years. \nGrowing in white spaces\nWe are continuing to fill white spaces, taking our brands into new markets  \nand expanding into emerging consumer segments, to create new growth opportunities. Today, people can buy  \nDove and Axe products in more than 70 countries; Cif in more than 60, following its expansion into China and Mexico in 2012; Knorr Jelly Bouillon in almost 40; and Clear in more than 40, after its successful 2012 launch in the US, Australia and Canada. In 2012, we successfully integrated two acquisitions, Kalina, the Russian personal care company, and Alberto Culver, the global hair and skincare company, and both are now experiencing double digit growth. \nIn November 2011, the TRESemm\u00e9 brand \nwas launched into Brazil just six months after the Alberto Culver acquisition was completed. We have since launched the brand in Indonesia, India, Thailand and  \nthe Philippines, proving our organisational capability to roll out a brand with speed and agility. Moreover, it demonstrates  \nour ability to transform an acquisition into a growth opportunity by swiftly launching its brands into new territories.\nWe are also looking to reach wide  \nby accelerating our presence through  \nthree important channels which have  \nall demonstrated high growth for us in \n2012: drug stores; e-commerce; and  \n\u2018out of home\u2019 (selling for consumers\u2019 consumption away from home). In drug stores, for example, we recorded our highest underlying sales growth of  \n11% in 2012 in this channel.\nLeveraging entire value chain\nLeveraging entire value chain\nReaching more consumers is also  \nabout partnering with our retailers to \nencourage shoppers to buy our brands  \nso that we can grow sustainably together across the value chain. We estimate  \nthat 68% of our greenhouse gas impact  \ncomes from consumers using our products, so we help customers engage with shoppers and consumers to adopt more sustainable lifestyles. \nTHE NEW  \nECONOMY \nThe economic crisis in Greece has led \nconsumers to switch to cheaper, local brands. Using our t r \nusted brand, Elais (named after  \nthe goddess of olive oil), we created a range  \nof value-for-money food products to tap  \ninto consumer needs. Our supply chain, customer, finance, sales and marketing teams collaborated swiftly to develop and launch \u2013 within six months \u2013 eight new economy products from olive oil to mayonnaise. At launch, the range was stocked in promotional displays to boost awareness and encourage people to buy. The new Elais range is one of  \nthe fastest growing recent launches in Greece. \nMore at: www.unilever.gr/elais\nUnilever  Annual Report and Accounts 2012\n 181 8"

As well as growing our sales,  \nit has delivered benefits ranging from consumers recycling more to people planting trees in the local community.\nTaking care of our customers\nWe believe that customer satisfaction  \nis the single most important measure of success for us in this area. And customers are more satisfied with us than ever.  \nIn 2012, Unilever was named supplier  \nof the year in the drug store channel,  \nin Boots and Superdrug (UK), Rite Aid (US), Shoppers DrugMart (Canada) and Farmacias Benavides (Mexico). Meanwhile, in emerging markets in Asia, Africa and  \nthe Middle East, we were rated the number one supplier in seven markets.

We\u2019re  \none of the largest buyers in the world, purchasing \nsome 3% of the total volume produced. \nImportantly, this is just the beginning. We also want  \nto know exactly where it comes from, so we\u2019re now \naiming to purchase entirely from traceable certified sources by 2020, which means we\u2019ll be able to track every tonne back to the certified plantation where it was grown. We\u2019ll be helped in this by our \u20ac69 million investment in a new palm kernel oil processing plant  \nin Indonesia, which will bring us closer to the source. We are also actively considering similar joint venture investments in processing crude palm oil derivatives  \nin South East Asia, India and West Africa.\nTIME FOR TEA   \nAs part of our plan to source tea sustainably,  \nfor the last six years we\u2019ve worked with the Kenya Tea Development Agency to educate its smallholder farmers about sustainable cultivation and Rainforest Alliance certification.  \nAnd it\u2019s working \u2013 many certified tea farmers are now achieving higher yields. Globally our programmes have contributed to training 450,000 smallholder farmers.\nSUPPLIER OF  \nTHE YEAR \nIn the UK, our supply  \nchain dramatically improved customer  \nservice through closer customer collaboration,  \na new planning process and a more responsive sourcing network.  \nWe were named the top multi-category supplier  \nin the Advantage Group Survey and supplier of  \nthe year by the major retailers including Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Boots.\nOUR SUPP L\nIERS  TO FIND OUT HOW WE PARTNER WITH SUPPLIERS TO MEET CONSUMERS\u2019 \nAND CUSTOMERS\u2019 NEEDS GO TO WWW.UNILEVER.COM/ABOUTUS/SUPPLIER .Our continuous improvement programme aims to deliver sustainable, profitable growth by seeking to add value at every step in the value chain by enhancing product quality and customer service,  \nand rolling out innovations faster. This approach, combined with our global scale, generates significant savings that we invest back into our brands and factories to fuel growth and fulfil our ambition  \nto reach more consumers. It\u2019s also  \nhelping us create new ways to source, manufacture and deliver our products more sustainably. Leveraging entire value chain\nLeveraging entire value chain\nBy working across the entire value  \nchain \u2013 from sourcing, manufacturing  \nand logistics through to innovation, \nadvertising and promotions, and pricing \u2013 we can use our global scale to add  \nvalue, reach new markets and meet  \nour sustainability targets. Working with global scale and local agilityOur procurement organisation now buys the majority of all materials and services centrally \u2013 some \u20ac35 billion in 2012.  \nThis scale improves our buying efficiency and has made a considerable contribution towards our \u20ac1.4 billion supply chain savings, double what we saved in 2007. \nWhen it comes to production, our \nphilosophy of \u2018design once, deploy everywhere\u2019, enables us to maximise  \nour global scale.

        "extracted_text": "22\nUnilever  Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Report of the Directors  About UnileverWINNING THROUGH CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT continued\nLocal relevance with low-cost  \nbusiness models\nOne of Unilever\u2019s particular strengths  \nis our ability to combine global scale  \nwith locally tailored solutions. We have identified several levers to improve our gross margin over the long term, one  \nof which is the application of \u2018low-cost business models\u2019 to parts of the business such as laundry. We expect a significant profitability uplift once these measures are implemented, enabling us to invest back into the business, maintaining and accelerating the momentum of the virtuous circle of growth.\nWorking in partnership with our suppliers\nOur scale also helps us to meet our ambitious targets for sustainable sourcing. In 2012, we sourced around one third of  \nall agricultural raw materials sustainably, including 100% of our palm oil, our largest agricultural raw material, three years ahead of schedule. Elsewhere, 39% of  \nall the tea we source comes from farms certified by the Rainforest Alliance. Sourcing sustainably means that farmers can improve their living conditions and earn an income they can live on. It also helps maintain and improve soil fertility, enhance water quality and availability,  \nand protect biodiversity.\nHowever, we cannot achieve our \nsustainable growth agenda alone. We  \nwork in partnership with our suppliers to support the growth and innovation we need. Through our \u2018Partner to Win\u2019 programme, we work with more than 150 strategic suppliers by sharing strategies and growth plans. This enables us to build capacity  \nand create new technologies. Our suppliers are also key to generating new ideas and are partnering with us on over 65% of the deliverables in our medium and long-term innovation projects. \nImproving eco-efficiency\nWe are also focusing on improving sustainability in our manufacturing network. Thanks to programmes to  \nreduce, reuse, recycle and recover,  \nover half our manufacturing sites now  \nsend zero non-hazardous waste to landfill. We sourced 26% of our energy used in manufacturing from renewables, and reduced our CO\n2 emissions from energy by \n838,000 tonnes in the period 2008 to 2012. These efforts have contributed towards the recognition by the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes, which named Unilever a global super-sector leader in 2012. Reaching more consumers\nTo meet our growth ambition we need  \nto reach more consumers. We continue  \nto work hard to ensure our products are always available wherever the consumer  \nis shopping. \nTo reach different kinds of consumers we \nhave developed segmented supply chains across categories, portfolios, geographies and channels to deliver the right service  \nat the right cost. For example, in Indonesia, Pond\u2019s is a premium brand that\u2019s often sold by small specialist retailers with little space to showcase the entire range and as a result they have a tendency to run out of stock. Following a successful trial, we now offer a daily delivery service, extending the roll-out to Greater Jakarta \u2013 experiencing sales growth of more than 80%.\nWe have been increasing on-shelf \navailability (OSA), getting more products more quickly on to shelves. In 2012, stores in our OSA programme reduced empty shelves by 13%.\nIn 2012, our customers rated us higher \nthan ever before. According to the global Advantage Group Survey, we improved in 70% of our key markets and are in the top third in ten out of 14 of our key markets. \nWe are also working hard to increase \nproduct quality \u2013 reducing both complaints and incidents. Consumer complaints  \nwere down by 29% in 2012 versus 2009, while product incidents were down by  \n75%. In addition, we are making and designing better products. In 2012, 57%  \nof our products scored higher than our competitors\u2019 in blind tests, compared  \nto just 21% in 2009. \nFast, flawle sss execu tion\nOur ability to deliver quality products, \ninnovate, and make better decisions quickly is critical to our sustainable  \ngrowth agenda. For example, we have almost halved the time it takes to launch key innovations into the market place.  \nNew capabilities and centralised processes are making it possible to  \nalmost halve the time it takes to build new factories. Unilever\u2019s Global Engineering Services uses \u2018cookie cutter\u2019 templates for factories, design and suppliers, helping us to deliver consistent high quality products wherever in the world they are made, as well as improving our speed to market.\nWe are also investing for growth and  \nare building world-class factories, \nenabling us to cater to the substantial volume growth so far. As well as increasing capacity and flexibility,  \nour new plants create competitiveness through manufacturing excellence  \nand by using sustainable technologies. \nZERO WASTE  \nTO LANDFILL\nOver half of our 252 manufacturing sites across \nthe world, from Costa Rica to Japan, send no non- h \nazardous waste to landfill, up from 74 at  \nthe start of the year. 100% of our sites send zero waste to landfill in 18 countries, the equivalent of removing over 1 million household bins of waste every year. This has been achieved by eliminating waste in the factories. We also reduced, reused, recycled and recovered waste. For example, in Russia, Unilever recycles tea bags to make animal bedding or wallpaper. \nMore at: www.unilever.com/sustainable-living"

By simplifying our internal processes, it is helping us both reduce costs and, by enabling us to act faster and with greater agility, improve  \nour service to customers.\nIn Finance Services, for example, we  \nhave simplified our reporting processes, \nsystems and tools, reducing our reporting time from 25 working days in 2010 to 19 today. We aim to reduce this still further.\nIn IT we are leveraging technology across \nUnilever which is helping us manage our growing business more efficiently. We have simplified 200 local IT transaction systems by replacing them with four  \nglobal systems, managed as one for speed and resilience. This is delivering many benefits, for example helping us integrate acquisitions swiftly \u2013 both Alberto Culver and the Sara Lee personal care brands were integrated in just over six months.\nWe are also using technology to improve \nour service to customers. More than 50,000 of our representatives in areas such as sales, merchandising and store auditing are connected to Unilever\u2019s information systems. They use mobile devices to help them carry out sales transactions and record and upload up-to-date market data. This lets us monitor how our products are being presented to shoppers in over 4 million stores in our \u2018Perfect Stores\u2019 programme (see page 17).\nIt\u2019s not just customers who are benefiting \n\u2013 we are talking directly to consumers  \ntoo through our digital hub which is connecting them securely with our brands across multiple digital channels. For example, we launched our Dove digital presence in 30 countries in just 30 days \u2013 just one of 650 brand activations across  \n50 countries. \nBringing it all together, in May 2012  \nwe opened a global operations centre  \nin Bangalore, tapping into the talent  \nand mindset of emerging markets.  \nThis is the heart of our global shared \nservices operations, and will support our end-to-end IT, Finance and Information Management across the whole of Unilever. \nMAKING  \nWHEEL SPIN\nAs part of our low-cost business model \nstrategy, we analysed every link in the value chai\nn for Wheel, our value washing powder in \nIndia. As a result of technology and productivity improvements in manufacturing as well as distributing the product from our factory direct to the customer, we delivered savings right across the value chain, ensuring our products are affordable to people on low incomes and reducing our carbon footprint.\nMore at: www.hul.co.in/wheel\nUnilever  Annual Report and Accounts 2012 23 Report of the Directors  About UnileverProduct incidents down \n 75%\nin 2012 versus 2009\nReduced CO2 emissions from  \nenergy from factory operations  \nbetween 2008 and 2012 by \n 838,000  tonnes \n"

Our new Four  \nAcres Learning and Leadership Centre  \nin Singapore, scheduled to open in mid-2013, is physical proof of this commitment. Like our long-standing Four Acres Centre in Kingston, UK, the facility will run a global curriculum to drive excellence and commitment to leadership development and sustainability. \nWe now have programmes for existing  \nand future leaders at all levels. These  \nare designed in a blended approach of \nleaders teaching leaders, senior executive sponsorship, academic rigour and application through job experience, mentors and coaches. \nA diverse business for a diverse world\nTwo billion people use our products every day and, if we are to meet their needs, we need to reflect their diversity in our own workplaces. Through better recruitment, family-friendly working conditions,  \na culture of accountability, and initiatives like employee networks and mentoring,  \nour business is becoming increasingly gender-balanced. By the end of 2012,  \n41% of our management headcount were women, compared to 39% at the end of 2011. After a decade of steady improvement, achieving an increase of more than 1%  \nin a single year shows progress \u2013 but we recognise there is still a long way to go. \nWe are working hard to improve further  \nand it is encouraging that we have received \nexternal recognition for our efforts. For example, we were: awarded the prestigious 2013 Catalyst Award; awarded Company  \nof the Year in the Vodafone European Diversity Awards 2012; named Top Employer by workingmums.co.uk; winners of Japanese magazine Toyo Keizai\u2019s Female Management Appointment Award for 2012; named among the 2012 Working Mother  \n100 Best Companies in the US; and our  \nUS business was given a 100% rating in  \nthe Human Rights Campaign\u2019s Corporate Equality Index.Values and  \nperforma nce culture\nOurs has always been a business based  \non values. We aim to ensure that integrity, responsibility, respect and pioneering spirit underpin our activities. In the last two years we have found new ways to express those values through the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP).\nEngaged employees\nWe have been encouraged by what our people are telling us about our culture.  \nOur Global People Survey (GPS) measures the level of engagement of all employees. Over 114,000 eligible employees participated in the 2012 survey, representing an 87% response rate. Our engagement score of 75%, up from 73% in the 2010 GPS, is now in line with the scores of high-performing employers in our class. \nOther key aspects of the survey also \nshowed good progress: scores rose by  \n5% for people management, and by 4% for performance culture, bias for action and diversity. We believe that the USLP and our values are significant factors in keeping employees fully engaged in our business \u2013 and therefore driving performance.\nEveryday heroes\nOur values are exemplified every day  \nby thousands of employees, without whom our business could not meet its ambitions for sustainable growth. But even amidst  \nall this good work, some actions stand  \nout. This year we honoured six employees nominated by their colleagues as \u2018Unilever heroes\u2019 \u2013 one of the ways in which we recognise significant contributions to society and our business. \nFOUR ACRES  \nSINGAPORE\nIn 2011, we began work on the Unilever  \nFour A\ncres Learning and Leadership Centre  \nin Singapore. The facility is on course to open  \nin mid-2013, and will provide learning and \ncapability development from our new global curriculum, designed to ensure that our people have the skills to meet our growth ambitions.  Four Acres Singapore has accommodation  \nfor 55 students and includes two flexible  \ntraining rooms, a teaching amphitheatre  \nand a multi-purpose hall for up to 200 people.\nMore at: www.unilever.com/  \ndeveloping-and-engaging-our-people\nUnilever  Annual Report and Accounts 2012"

Where we formerly  \ndealt with 22 geographical sub-entities,  \nwe now divide our business between  \neight markets, six of which are primarily  \nmade up of developing economies.  \nThis streamlined structure has allowed  \nus to focus sharply on growth, particularly in emerging markets.

Our ambition is to record zero accidents. We focus continuously on improving safety through the positive behaviour of our  \npeople, the design of our plants, facilities and products, and by implementing safe systems and procedures throughout Unilever.\nA key measure of our progress, set out in the USLP, is the total \nrecordable accident frequency rate, which counts all employee workplace accidents except those requiring only simple first  \naid treatment. This year our total recordable accident frequency rate was down by 9%\n\u2020 compared with 2011. \n\u2020  2012 data is preliminary.

This was primarily driven by strong growth in \nemerging markets which grew in volume and value terms, while developed markets remained largely unchanged due to continued weak consumer confidence in Western Europe and North America. \nDespite the challenging environment, we have delivered strong underlying sales growth of  \n6.9% (2011: 6.5%) . We accelerated volume growth to 3.4% (2011: 1.6%), well balanced with a 3.3% \ncontribution from price (2011: 4.8%). All of our categories and each of our three geographical areas \nreported positive growth. \nAs in the prior year, emerging markets were the key growth drivers with underlying sales up 11.4%. \nWe achieved double-digit growth in many countries, including Indonesia, China, Brazil and Vietnam. In developed markets we managed to grow the business despite difficult markets: our underlying sales were up 1.6%, split equally between volume and price. \nOur focus on bigger and better innovation, rolled out faster to more markets is a key driver behind \nour performance. The rollout of our brands to new markets, including the more recently acquired brands, such as the launch of TRESemm\u00e9 in Brazil also contributed strongly. \nAmongst our categories, Home Care and Personal Care grew ahead of the markets, up 10.3% and \n10.0% respectively; resulting in solid market share gains. In Home Care, we outperformed market growth in laundry and household cleaning. In Personal Care, our hair care business garnered market shares around the world, and skin care as well as deodorants reflected the success of innovations. \nIn Foods, underlying sales growth of 1.8% reflects a mixed performance, benefiting from the rollout \nof new products and our marketing campaigns to introduce new uses of our products to consumers. At the same time, declining markets in our spreads business and the impact of price rises we took  \nin 2011 to counter sharply increased raw material costs impacted growth momentum. \n6.3% underlying sales growth in Refreshment reflects the continued success of the global rollout  \nof our ice cream brands and innovations, as well as improved growth momentum in tea, especially  \nin emerging markets.\nSolid progress in core operating margin\nDespite further increases in input costs and adverse currency changes, gross margin improved  \nby 0.1% to 40.0% at constant exchange rates, reflecting disciplined cost management and our \nincreased focus on improving gross margin consistently. \nCore operating margin was up 0.3% to 13.8%, driven by the progress in gross margin, continued \nsavings programmes and lower expenses for restructuring . Advertising and promotional expenses \nincreased by \u20ac470 million, at constant exchange rates.\nStrong free cash flow generation \nFree cash flow of \u20ac4.3 billion was up by \u20ac1.2 billion, driven by higher operating profit and improvement in working capital management.  \nConsistent management focus has resulted in negative working capital for 13 consecutive quarters with further progress in all its components: inventories, trade receivables and trade payables. \nNet capital expenditure of \u20ac2.1 billion was in line with last year, at 4.2% of turnover, reflecting \ninvestment in the capacity required for our growing business.

Underlying sales growth increased to 6.9%, well balanced between volume growth of 3.4% and price contributions of 3.3%. As in the prior year, emerging markets grew strongly, with underlying sales up 11.4% and now representing 55% of total turnover. \nOperating profit was \u20ac7.0 billion, compared with \u20ac6.4 billion in \n2011, up 9%. The increase was driven by higher gross profit and improved cost discipline. Core operating profit was \u20ac7.1 billion,  \nup 12% from \u20ac6.3 billion in 2011, reflecting the additional impact of lower one-off credits within non-core items.\nThe cost of financing net borrowings was \u20ac390 million, \u20ac58 million \nless than in 2011. The average level of net debt increased by \u20ac0.7 billion to \u20ac8.9 billion, reflecting the full-year impact of financing prior year acquisitions such as Alberto Culver. The average interest rate was 3.5% on debt and 2.9% on cash deposits. The pensions financing cost was a charge of \u20ac7 million, compared to a \u20ac71 million credit in 2011. \nThe effective tax rate was 26.4% compared with 26.5% in 2011. Net profit from joint ventures and associates, together with other \nincome from non-current investments, contributed \u20ac91 million in 2012, compared to \u20ac189 million in the prior year. Assets related to businesses sold in previous years recorded positive adjustments to fair value in 2011, whilst similar but unrelated assets were impaired in 2012.\nFully diluted earnings per share were \u20ac1.54, up 5% from \u20ac1.46  \nin the prior year. Higher operating profit was the key driver with \nlower profits from business disposals and one-off items, partially offset by higher minority interests and pension costs and a lower contribution from non-current investments.

Innovation and the rollout of our brands into new markets supported the growth momentum, which resulted in double-digit growth in a number of countries, including Indonesia, China, Thailand and India.\n\u2022\tGains in value market share were primarily driven by the Personal Care and Home Care categories, on the back of strong sustained momentum in haircare, deodorants and household care.

A summary of certain contractual obligations at 31 December 2012 is provided in the preceding table. Further details are set out in the following notes to the consolidated financial statements: note 10 on pages 107  \nto 108, note 15C on page 115, and note 20 on pages 125 to 126.\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nSIC interpretation 12 \u2018Consolidation \u2013 Special Purpose Entities\u2019 (SIC 12) requires that entities are considered for consolidation  \nin the financial statements based on risks and rewards. In line with this, all appropriate entities are included in Unilever\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Information concerning guarantees given by the Group is stated in note 16A on page 117.\nFinance and liquidity\nThe Group\u2019s financial strategy provides the financial flexibility  \nto meet strategic and day-to-day needs. Our current long-term credit rating is A+/A1 and our current short-term credit rating is A1/P1. We aim to maintain a competitive balance sheet which we consider to be the equivalent of a credit rating of A+/A1 in the long term. This provides us with:\u2022\tappropriate access to equity and debt markets;\n\u2022\tsufficient flexibility for acquisitions;\n\u2022\tsufficient resilience against economic and financial uncertainty ensuring ample liquidity; and\n\u2022\toptimal weighted average cost of capital, given the constraints\u00a0above.\nUnilever aims to concentrate cash in the parent and central finance companies in order to ensure maximum flexibility in meeting changing business needs. Operating subsidiaries are financed through the mixture of retained earnings, third-party borrowings and loans from parent and central finance companies. Unilever maintains access to global debt markets through an infrastructure of short-term debt programmes (principally US domestic and euro commercial paper programmes) and long-term debt programmes (principally a US Shelf Registration programme and a European markets Debt Issuance Programme). Debt in the international markets is, in general, issued in the name of NV, PLC, Unilever Finance International BV or Unilever Capital Corporation. NV, PLC and Unilever United States Inc.  \nwill normally\u00a0guarantee such debt where they are not the issuer.\nIn this uncertain environment, we have continued to closely \nmonitor all our exposures and counterparty limits. We were comfortable with a high cash balance in 2012.\nUnilever has committed credit facilities in place for general \ncorporate purposes. The undrawn committed credit facilities in\u00a0place on 31 December 2012 were US $6,250 million.  \nBilateral committed credit facilities totalled US $6,140 million. Bilateral money market commitments totalled US $110 million. Further\u00a0details are given in note 16A on page 116."

Unilever is satisfied that its financing arrangements are adequate to meet its working capital needs for the foreseeable\u00a0future.\nTreasury\nUnilever Treasury\u2019s role is to ensure that appropriate financing  \nis available for all value-creating investments. Additionally, Treasury delivers financial services to allow operating companies to manage their financial transactions and exposures in an efficient, timely and low-cost manner.\nUnilever Treasury is governed by standards approved by the \nUnilever Leadership Executive. In addition to guidelines and exposure limits, a system of authorities and extensive independent reporting covers all major areas of activity. Performance is monitored closely. Reviews are undertaken periodically by the corporate internal audit function.\nThe key financial instruments used by Unilever are short-term \nand long-term borrowings, cash and cash equivalents, and certain plain vanilla derivative instruments, principally comprising interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts. The accounting for derivative instruments is discussed in note  \n16 on page 116 and on page 120. The use of leveraged instruments is not permitted.\nUnilever Treasury manages a variety of market risks, including \nthe effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and liquidity.

We believe this information, along with comparable GAAP measurements, is\u00a0useful to investors because it provides a basis\u00a0for measuring our\u00a0operating performance, ability to retire debt and invest in new\u00a0business opportunities. Our management uses these financial measures, along with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, in evaluating our operating performance and value creation. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures as reported by us may not be comparable with similarly\u00a0titled amounts reported by other companies. \nIn the following sections we set out our definitions of the following \nnon-GAAP measures and provide reconciliations to\u00a0relevant GAAP measures:\u2022\tunderlying sales growth;\n\u2022\tunderlying volume growth;\n\u2022\tcore operating profit and core operating margin (including acquisition and disposal related costs, gain/(loss) on disposal of group companies, impairments and other one-off items (non-core items));\n\u2022\tcore earnings per share (core EPS);\n\u2022\tfree cash flow; and\n\u2022\tnet debt.\nUnderlying sales growth (USG)\nUSG reflects the change in revenue from continuing operations at\u00a0constant rates of exchange, excluding the effects of acquisitions and disposals. It is a measure that provides valuable additional information on the underlying performance of the business. In particular, it presents the organic growth of our business year on year and is used internally as a core measure of sales performance.\nThe reconciliation of USG to changes in the GAAP measure \nturnover is as follows:\nTotal Group\n \n 2012\nvs 20112011\nvs 2010\nUnderlying sales growth (%) 6.9 6.5\nEffect of acquisitions (%) 1.8 2.7\nEffect of disposals (%) (0.7) (1.5)\nEffect of exchange rates (%) 2.2 (2.5)\nTurnover growth (%) 10.5 5.0\nPersonal Care \n  2012\nvs 20112011\nvs 2010\nUnderlying sales growth (%) 10.0 8.2\nEffect of acquisitions (%) 4.4 7.3\nEffect of disposals (%) (0.5) (0.2)\nEffect of exchange rates (%) 2.3 (2.9)\nTurnover growth (%) 17.0 12.4Foods\n  2012\nvs 20112011\nvs 2010\nUnderlying sales growth (%) 1.8 4.9\nEffect of acquisitions (%) \u2013 0.2\nEffect of disposals (%) (1.5) (4.3)\nEffect of exchange rates (%) 3.0 (1.9)\nTurnover growth (%) 3.3 (1.3)\n \nRefreshment\n \n 2012\nvs 20112011\nvs 2010\nUnderlying sales growth (%) 6.3 4.9\nEffect of acquisitions (%) 0.8 0.3\nEffect of disposals (%) 0.7 (0.3)\nEffect of exchange rates (%) 2.4 (2.5)\nTurnover growth (%) 10.5 2.3\nHome Care\n  2012\nvs 20112011\nvs 2010\nUnderlying sales growth (%) 10.3 8.1\nEffect of acquisitions (%) 0.6 1.3\nEffect of disposals (%) (1.1) 0.1\nEffect of exchange rates (%) 0.6 (3.1)\nTurnover growth (%) 10.4 6.2\nUnderlying volume growth (UVG)\nUnderlying volume growth is underlying sales growth after \neliminating the impact of price changes. The relationship between\u00a0the two measures is set out below:\n \n 2012\nvs 20112011\nvs 2010\nUnderlying volume growth (%) 3.4 1.6\nEffect of price changes (%) 3.3 4.8\nUnderlying sales growth (%) 6.9 6.5\nThe UVG and price effect for category and geographical area are \nshown in the tables on pages 30 to 31.\nFree cash flow (FCF)\nFree cash flow represents the cash generated from the operation and financing of the business. The movement in FCF measures our progress against the commitment to deliver strong cash flows. FCF is not used as a liquidity measure within Unilever. FCF\u00a0includes the cash flow from group operating activities, less\u00a0income tax paid, net capital expenditure, net interest and\u00a0preference dividends paid."

The actual results could differ materially from those projected.  \nSee the \u2018Cautionary statement\u2019 on the inside back cover.\nOutlook\nMarket conditions for our business were challenging in 2012 and we do not anticipate this changing significantly in 2013. \nEconomic pressures are expected to continue. We expect consumer markets to remain flat to slightly down in developed markets.  \nIn emerging markets consumer demand remains robust but there is nonetheless the risk of modest slowdown in key markets such  \nas China, India and Brazil. Currency markets remain volatile and uncertain. Although we have seen rather more stable conditions  \nin key commodity markets in 2012 we remain watchful for further periods of volatility in 2013. A worsening economic scenario could  \nbe triggered by a major Eurozone crisis prompted by countries leaving the euro or by a break-up of the euro leading to significant \ncontraction in financial markets, followed by a severe recession in Europe and knock-on effects globally. Terrorist activity and political unrest may also result in business interruptions and a decreased demand for our products. \nThe competitive environment for our business is likely to remain intense in 2013. Our competitors, both global and local, will continue  \nto shift resources into emerging markets. We expect continued high levels of competitive challenge to our many category leadership \npositions. Some of this may be price based, but we also expect strong innovation based competition. With the improvements we have been making to our business we are well prepared for these challenges. \nIn a period of significant uncertainty and downside risk, we believe Unilever\u2019s operational and financial flexibility, and speed of response \nto a fast changing environment are vital assets. We will continue to focus on our long term strategic priority of driving volume growth ahead of our markets whilst providing a steady improvement in core operating margin and strong cash flow. We are well placed in emerging markets and we expect these markets to continue to drive growth. Our portfolio strategy defines the role of our categories and our 2013 outlook fully reflects the choices made. This gives us confidence that Unilever is fit to win, whatever the circumstances.\nPrincipal risk factors\nOur business is subject to risks and uncertainties. The risks that we regard as the most relevant to our business are identified below. We have also commented on certain mitigating actions that we believe help us to manage these risks. However, we may not be successful in deploying some or all of these mitigating actions. If the circumstances in these risks occur or are not successfully mitigated, our cashflow, operating results, financial position, business and reputation could be materially adversely affected. In addition risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to vary from those described below, which may include forward-looking statements, or could impact on our ability to meet  \nour targets or be detrimental to our profitability or reputation. \nDescription of risk  What we a re doing to manage the risk\nConsumer Preference\nAs a branded goods business, Unilever\u2019s success depends on  \nthe value and relevance of our brands and products to consumers \nacross the world and on our ability to innovate.\nConsumer tastes, preferences and behaviours are constantly \nchanging and Unilever\u2019s ability to respond to these changes and  \nto continue to differentiate our brands and products is vital to  \nour business.\nWe are dependent on creating innovative products that continue  \nto meet the needs of our consumers. If we are unable to innovate \neffectively, Unilever\u2019s sales or margins could be materially adversely affected.We continuously monitor external market trends and collate consumer, customer and shopper insight in order to develop category and brand strategies. \nOur Research and Development function actively searches for \nways in which to translate the trends in consumer preference and taste into new technologies for incorporation into future products.\nOur innovation management process deploys the necessary  \ntools, technologies and resources to convert category strategies \ninto projects and category plans, develop products and relevant brand communication and successfully roll out new products  \nto our consumers."

In doing this we take an embedded approach to risk management which puts risk and opportunity assessment  \nat the core of the leadership team agenda, which is where  \nwe believe it should be.\nUnilever adopts a risk profile that is aligned to our vision to  \ndouble the size of our business while reducing our environmental \nfootprint and increasing our positive social impact.

This organisational structure and distribution of accountabilities and responsibilities ensures that every country in which we operate has specific resources and processes for risk review and risk mitigation. This is supported by the Unilever Leadership Executive, which takes an active responsibility for focusing on the principal areas of risk to Unilever. The Boards regularly review these risk areas, including consideration of environmental, social and governance matters, and retain responsibility for determining the nature and extent of the significant risks that Unilever is prepared to take to achieve its strategic objectives.\nFoundation and Principles\nUnilever\u2019s approach to doing business is framed by our Corporate Purpose. Our Code of Business Principles sets out the standards of behaviour that we expect all employees to adhere to. Day-to-day responsibility for ensuring these principles are applied throughout Unilever rests with senior management across categories, geographies and functions. A network of Code Officers and Committees supports the activities necessary to communicate the Code, deliver training, maintain processes and procedures (including \u2018hotlines\u2019) to report and respond to alleged breaches, and to capture and communicate learnings.\nWe have a framework of Code Policies that underpin the Code and \nset out the non-negotiable standards of behaviour expected from all our employees. \nUnilever\u2019s functional standards define mandatory requirements \nacross a range of specialist areas such as health and safety, accounting and reporting and financial risk management.Processes Unilever operates a wide range of processes and activities  \nacross all its operations covering strategy, planning, execution and performance management. Risk management is integrated into every stage of this business cycle. These procedures are formalised and documented and are increasingly being centralised and automated into transactional and other information technology systems.\nAssurance and Re-Assurance\nAssurance on compliance with the Code of Business Principles and all of our Code Policies is obtained annually from Unilever management via a formal Code declaration. In addition, there  \nare specialist compliance programmes which run during the year and vary depending on the\u00a0business priorities. These specialist compliance programmes supplement the Code declaration.  \nOur Corporate Audit function plays a vital role in providing to both management and the Boards an objective and independent review of the effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems throughout Unilever.\nBoards\u2019 assessment of compliance with the Risk \nManagement frameworks\nThe Boards, advised by the Committees where appropriate, \nregularly review the significant risks and decisions that could have a material impact on Unilever. These reviews consider the boundaries to the risks that Unilever is prepared to take in pursuit of the business strategy and the effectiveness of the management controls in place to mitigate the risk exposure. \nThe Boards, through the Audit Committee, have reviewed the \nassessment of risks, internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures in operation within Unilever. They have also considered the effectiveness of any remedial actions taken for  \nthe year covered by this document and up to the date of its approval by the Boards. \nDetails of the activities of the Audit Committee in relation to  \nthis can be found in the Report of the Audit Committee on pages \n56 and 57.\nFurther statements on compliance with the specific risk \nmanagement and control requirements in the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, the UK Corporate Governance Code, the US Securities Exchange Act (1934) and the Sarbanes-Oxley (2002)  \nAct can be found on pages 52 to 54."
