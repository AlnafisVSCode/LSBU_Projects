HASSAN, STEPHAN HOLLANDER, LAURENCE VAN LENT,\nand AHMED TAHOUN*\nABSTRACT\nWe propose a text-based method for measuring the cross-border propagation of large\nshocks at the \ufb01rm level. We apply this method to estimate the expected costs, bene\ufb01ts,\nand risks of Brexit and \ufb01nd widespread reverberations in listed \ufb01rms in 81 countries.\nInternational (i.e., non-U.K.) \ufb01rms most exposed to Brexit uncertainty (the second\nmoment) lost signi\ufb01cant market value and reduced hiring and investment. Interna-\ntional \ufb01rms also overwhelmingly expected negative \ufb01rst-moment impacts from the\nU.K.\u2019s decision to leave the European Union (EU), particularly related to regulation,\nasset prices, and labor market impacts of Brexit.\nBREXIT ,THE U.K.\u2019 S MOMENTOUS DECISION to leave the European Union\n(EU), exempli\ufb01es how political and economic shocks in one country can prop-\nagate to affect \ufb01rms in other countries and across the globe. How exactly\nthese shocks transmit through the world economy, however, is an open ques-\ntion, not least to the policymakers and politicians struggling to \ufb01nd an\n*Tarek A.

We propose to construct such a measure from\ntranscripts of earnings conference calls between \ufb01rm management and \ufb01nan-\ncial analysts when they talk about Brexit, or more generally, any other speci\ufb01c\nshock (e.g., the Fukushima nuclear disaster, as we brie\ufb02y illustrate in the In-\nternet Appendix ).2We demonstrate how a text-based approach can capture a\ngiven \ufb01rm\u2019s exposure to the shock and provide a way to decompose the \ufb01rm\u2019s\nexposure into expected costs, bene\ufb01ts, and risks as assessed by the \ufb01rm\u2019s man-\nagement and analysts. We then illustrate our approach with a comprehensive\nempirical analysis of how U.S. and other international (i.e., non-U.K.) \ufb01rms\nresponded to the Brexit referendum shock and provide direct evidence of the\nglobal repercussions of Brexit uncertainty.\nSeveral recent papers aim to estimate the effects of Brexit on U.K.-based\n\ufb01rms (e.g., Sampson ( 2017 ), Graziano, Handley, and Lim\u00e3o ( 2021 ), Broadbent\net al. ( 2019 )).3Notably, Bloom et al. ( 2019 ) use detailed surveys among U.K.\nbusinesses to isolate the impact of Brexit uncertainty within the United King-\ndom. However, absent the ability to conduct similar surveys at thousands of\ninternational \ufb01rms, considerable challenges confront attempts to quantify the\neffects of Brexit uncertainty on \ufb01rms outside the U.K. (and, for that matter,\nthe cross-border propagation of any shock).\nFirst, the intricacies of global trade relations complicate measurement of\nany \ufb01rm\u2019s exposure to a shock in this interweaved network. Regulatory hur-\ndles, barriers to product market access, and frictions in managing relation-\nships with customers and suppliers, may be among the many ways a shock in\none country can impact \ufb01rms in other geographies. Financial statements and\nother corporate regulatory \ufb01lings may not re\ufb02ect many of these economically\nsigni\ufb01cant but potentially indirect exposures. Second, while stock returns in\nresponse to a given event (such as the outcome of the Brexit vote) can hint at\nwinners and losers, asset prices are generally silent on why a particular \ufb01rm\nis affected by the event. Firms\u2019 stock prices may respond to increases in risk\n(the second moment) in the same way they respond to bad news (the \ufb01rst mo-\nment), preventing researchers from teasing out the effects of the uncertainty\ngenerated by Brexit. This distinction is crucial, however, for formulating an\neffective policy response. Third, a \ufb01rm\u2019s exposure to Brexit is not constant over\ntime. When researchers infer exposure from isolated events, they are likely to\n1Witness, for example, President Macron\u2019s comment that he would rather have a \u201cno-deal\u201d\nBrexit than continued uncertainty troubling the French economy (Water\ufb01eld, Wright, and Zeffman\n(2019 )).\n2The Internet Appendix is available in the online version of the article on The Journal of Fi-\nnance website.\n3Other papers documenting the negative impact of Brexit on U.K. investment, employment,\nwages, trade, lending, and competition include Born et al. ( 2019 ), Berg et al. ( 2021 ), Van Reenen\n(2016 ), Breinlich et al. ( 2018 ), Davies and Studnicka ( 2018 ), Dhingra et al. ( 2017 ), Garetto, Olden-\nski, and Ramondo ( 2019 ), Costa, Dhingra, and Machin ( 2019 ), McGrattan and Waddle ( 2020 ), and\nSteinberg ( 2019 ).\n 15406261, 2024, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.13293 by Test, Wiley Online Library on [08/05/2024].
