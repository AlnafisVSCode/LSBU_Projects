We propose to construct such a measure from\ntranscripts of earnings conference calls between \ufb01rm management and \ufb01nan-\ncial analysts when they talk about Brexit, or more generally, any other speci\ufb01c\nshock (e.g., the Fukushima nuclear disaster, as we brie\ufb02y illustrate in the In-\nternet Appendix ).2We demonstrate how a text-based approach can capture a\ngiven \ufb01rm\u2019s exposure to the shock and provide a way to decompose the \ufb01rm\u2019s\nexposure into expected costs, bene\ufb01ts, and risks as assessed by the \ufb01rm\u2019s man-\nagement and analysts. We then illustrate our approach with a comprehensive\nempirical analysis of how U.S. and other international (i.e., non-U.K.) \ufb01rms\nresponded to the Brexit referendum shock and provide direct evidence of the\nglobal repercussions of Brexit uncertainty.\nSeveral recent papers aim to estimate the effects of Brexit on U.K.-based\n\ufb01rms (e.g., Sampson ( 2017 ), Graziano, Handley, and Lim\u00e3o ( 2021 ), Broadbent\net al. ( 2019 )).3Notably, Bloom et al. ( 2019 ) use detailed surveys among U.K.\nbusinesses to isolate the impact of Brexit uncertainty within the United King-\ndom. However, absent the ability to conduct similar surveys at thousands of\ninternational \ufb01rms, considerable challenges confront attempts to quantify the\neffects of Brexit uncertainty on \ufb01rms outside the U.K. (and, for that matter,\nthe cross-border propagation of any shock).\nFirst, the intricacies of global trade relations complicate measurement of\nany \ufb01rm\u2019s exposure to a shock in this interweaved network. Regulatory hur-\ndles, barriers to product market access, and frictions in managing relation-\nships with customers and suppliers, may be among the many ways a shock in\none country can impact \ufb01rms in other geographies. Financial statements and\nother corporate regulatory \ufb01lings may not re\ufb02ect many of these economically\nsigni\ufb01cant but potentially indirect exposures. Second, while stock returns in\nresponse to a given event (such as the outcome of the Brexit vote) can hint at\nwinners and losers, asset prices are generally silent on why a particular \ufb01rm\nis affected by the event. Firms\u2019 stock prices may respond to increases in risk\n(the second moment) in the same way they respond to bad news (the \ufb01rst mo-\nment), preventing researchers from teasing out the effects of the uncertainty\ngenerated by Brexit. This distinction is crucial, however, for formulating an\neffective policy response. Third, a \ufb01rm\u2019s exposure to Brexit is not constant over\ntime. When researchers infer exposure from isolated events, they are likely to\n1Witness, for example, President Macron\u2019s comment that he would rather have a \u201cno-deal\u201d\nBrexit than continued uncertainty troubling the French economy (Water\ufb01eld, Wright, and Zeffman\n(2019 )).\n2The Internet Appendix is available in the online version of the article on The Journal of Fi-\nnance website.\n3Other papers documenting the negative impact of Brexit on U.K. investment, employment,\nwages, trade, lending, and competition include Born et al. ( 2019 ), Berg et al. ( 2021 ), Van Reenen\n(2016 ), Breinlich et al. ( 2018 ), Davies and Studnicka ( 2018 ), Dhingra et al. ( 2017 ), Garetto, Olden-\nski, and Ramondo ( 2019 ), Costa, Dhingra, and Machin ( 2019 ), McGrattan and Waddle ( 2020 ), and\nSteinberg ( 2019 ).\n 15406261, 2024, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.13293 by Test, Wiley Online Library on [08/05/2024].

As a case in point,\nthe prolonged political process stemming from the 2016 referendum yielded a\nseries of potential negotiation outcomes, with the implications of each vary-ing across \ufb01rms. Put differently, a \ufb01rm may appear to be a Brexit \u201cwinner\u201d\none day, only to \ufb01nd itself in a disadvantaged position the next. Isolating the\nglobal impact of Brexit uncertainty thus requires separately tracking interna-\ntional \ufb01rms\u2019 \ufb01rst- and second-moment exposures over time.\nOur study addresses each of these challenges. Using natural language pro-\ncessing, we propose a general text-based method for isolating \ufb01rst- and second-\nmoment impacts stemming from speci\ufb01c shocks. Our approach identi\ufb01es the\nexposure of \ufb01rms to a given shock (in this case, Brexit) by counting the num-ber of times the event is mentioned in a given \ufb01rm\u2019s quarterly earnings confer-\nence call. These earnings calls usually occur together with an earnings release\nand are an opportunity for management to describe the company\u2019s current af-fairs. After the management\u2019s presentation, analysts query management on\nchallenges the \ufb01rm is facing. We expect managers and analysts to devote more\ntime to events of greater importance to the \ufb01rm, in which case the time spentdiscussing an event is a powerful measure of a \ufb01rm\u2019s exposure to it. Further,\nsince participants in these earnings calls are arguably among the foremost\nexperts on the \ufb01rm, any signi\ufb01cant impact of Brexit on a \ufb01rm\u2019s \ufb01nancial, prod-uct, and labor markets will likely come up in these calls. Thus, earnings calls\nallow us to identify market-assessed, over-time variation in Brexit exposure\nfrom the moment that talks of a Brexit referendum began (before 2016) until\nthe present. Indeed, our method allows us to track changes in \ufb01rm-level Brexit\nexposure (due to, e.g., developments in EU-U.K. negotiations) without need-ing to conduct surveys of executives in multiple countries. Finally, we adapt\nthe method developed by Hassan et al. ( 2019 ) to separate our measure of\nBrexit exposure into its \ufb01rst moment ( BrexitSentiment ) and second moment\n(BrexitRisk ). Speci\ufb01cally, we rely on call participants\u2019 use of \u201crisk\u201d and \u201cuncer-\ntainty\u201d synonyms near the term \u201cBrexit\u201d to measure BrexitRisk and their use of\npositive- and negative-tone words near \u201cBrexit\u201d to capture BrexitSentiment .B y\ndisentangling risk and sentiment, we take an important \ufb01rst step in providing\nevidence on the mechanisms at play in a \ufb01rm\u2019s response to a signi\ufb01cant shock,\nthat is, on the extent to which \ufb01rst- versus second-moment effects explain \ufb01rmpolicy outcomes. Further, our text-based approach allows us to investigate the\nnature of Brexit-related impacts by identifying the exact concerns that call\nparticipants raise when discussing Brexit.\nUsing these new measures, we document novel empirical \ufb01ndings on the\nimpact of Brexit on \ufb01rms in 81 countries. While these \ufb01ndings validate our\nmeasures of Brexit shock exposure, they are also signi\ufb01cant in their own right.For example, not only do we document that concerns about Brexit became more\npronounced for U.K. \ufb01rms in the second quarter of 2019 when a no-deal Brexit\nbecame a possibility, but we also show that concerns about Brexit-related risks\nwere widespread among non-U.K. \ufb01rms. For instance, on average, Brexit risk is\ndiscussed signi\ufb01cantly more for Irish \ufb01rms than U.K. \ufb01rms, and Brexit risk isa concern for \ufb01rms as far a\ufb01eld as the United States, South Africa, and\n 15406261, 2024, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.13293 by Test, Wiley Online Library on [08/05/2024].

When we aggregate\nBrexitSentiment to the country level, no single country has a signi\ufb01cantly\npositive average. Only in tax havens such as the Channel Islands is aver-\nage sentiment toward Brexit positive, although the effect is not statistically\ndistinguishable from zero.\nThrough a human audit of a large number of text fragments from earnings\ncalls that mention Brexit, we next determine the content of the associated\ndiscussions. We \ufb01nd that the topics most frequently raised in discussions of\nBrexit risk relate to consumer con\ufb01dence, logistics and transition costs, as-\nset prices, trade deals, and regulatory issues. Interestingly, discussion of all of\nthese topics is associated with a signi\ufb01cantly negative tone, suggesting more\nlosers than winners in each case, even among U.K. \ufb01rms. The most negatively\ntoned discussions focus on Brexit\u2019s impact on regulation, asset prices, and the\nlabor market. In the most positively toned text fragments, managers express\nrelief that their \ufb01rm has little exposure to Brexit. Consistent with this gener-\nally negative outlook, we \ufb01nd little to no discussion about the major economic\nbene\ufb01ts touted by the Vote Leave campaign (such as looser regulation or better\ntrade deals), even for U.K.-based \ufb01rms.\nWe next examine how U.S. and other international \ufb01rms respond to their\nBrexit shock exposure. Using our time-varying \ufb01rm-speci\ufb01c measure, we show\nthat, up to the end of our sample period in December 2019, Brexit exposure\nmostly affects \ufb01rm-level actions through risk, as opposed to sentiment. Specif-\nically, we document meaningful negative effects of BrexitRisk on \ufb01rms\u2019 invest-\nment and employment decisions.4For example, we estimate that in response\nto Brexit risk, on average Irish \ufb01rms decreased investment by 2.53% and net\nhiring by 3.75%, relative to the mean in each of the \ufb01rst three years after the\nBrexit referendum. For U.S.-based \ufb01rms (which on average are as exposed to\nBrexit as Greek \ufb01rms), reductions in average investment and net hiring rates\nare 0.33% and 0.86%, respectively.\nAlthough we lack a formal instrument for Brexit exposure, we address the\nthree most plausible challenges to a causal interpretation of these results.\nFirst, corporate executives may use Brexit and Brexit risk as an excuse to\njustify poor performance. Second, \ufb01rms exposed to Brexit risk may also be\nmore exposed to other types of risks that explain changes in \ufb01rms\u2019 investment\nand employment. Third, \ufb01rms doing business with the United Kingdom. may\nbe systematically different from other \ufb01rms. We investigate these alternative\ninterpretations of our \ufb01ndings in a range of robustness checks and placebo\nexperiments but \ufb01nd little supporting evidence. For example, our estimates re-\nmain unchanged when we control for measures of \ufb01rms\u2019 current performance\nand hence executives\u2019 incentives to engage in \u201ccheap talk\u201d about Brexit. Sim-\nilarly, our results remain unchanged when we control for the time spent dis-\ncussing risks unrelated to Brexit and for the \ufb01rm\u2019s exposure to trade policy\n4Bansal et al.

Adding further controls for possibly unobserved heterogeneity correlated\nwith Brexit and investment or hiring does not change our results.\nWe supplement these analyses with two additional pieces of evidence. First,\nwe investigate how stock markets reacted to the outcome of the U.K.\u2019s Brexit\nreferendum on June 23, 2016. We show that BrexitSentiment is positively as-\nsociated with stock returns in a narrow window around the referendum date,\nwhereas the association with BrexitRisk is signi\ufb01cantly negative. In other\nwords, both \ufb01rst- and second-moment exposure to Brexit is quickly impoundedinto stock prices after the announcement of the referendum result. The market\nthus prices international \ufb01rms\u2019 Brexit-related costs, opportunities, and risks.\nSecond, we examine whether the average Brexit exposure of \ufb01rms in a given\nU.K. district is associated with the share of that district\u2019s electorate who voted\nto leave the EU in the 2016 referendum. Our \ufb01ndings show that constituents\nwho live closer to the \ufb01rms most negatively affected by Brexit tended to voteto remain in the EU.\nTaken together, the evidence suggests that prior to the U.K.\u2019s actual with-\ndrawal from the EU in January 2020, the Brexit referendum vote mostly af-fected \ufb01rm actions through increased uncertainty. While stock markets rec-\nognized and priced both Brexit sentiment and Brexit risk, the \ufb01rst-moment\neffects of Brexit on \ufb01rm actions had not yet been realized. That is, \ufb01rms\u2019 realdecisions were predominantly a response to increased uncertainty rather than\nto changes in the mean of their exposure to the Brexit shock (i.e., whether the\nshock is good or bad news for the \ufb01rm). In this sense, our analysis suggests\nthat many of Brexit\u2019s (negative) \ufb01rst-moment effects will materialize over a\nlonger period.\nRelated literature . Our work relates to a large literature on the spillover\nof shocks across borders and on \u201ccontagion.\u201d A long-standing idea in this\nliterature is that an uncertainty shock from one region can affect valuationsand investment across the world (Forbes and Warnock ( 2012 ), Rey ( 2015 ),\nMaggiori ( 2017 ), Colacito et al. ( 2018 )). Our work documents a concrete and\nwell-identi\ufb01ed example of such a spillover, with uncertainty in the U.K. affect-ing valuations, investment, and other precautionary behavior in the United\nStates and other countries. We believe that it represents the \ufb01rst example of\nsuch a transmitted shock to uncertainty identi\ufb01ed in \ufb01rm-level data.\nOur work also relates to a wider literature that documents the transmis-\nsion of speci\ufb01c natural disasters or credit supply shocks across borders using\ndata on subsidiaries or customer-supplier networks (e.g., Schnabl ( 2012 ), Bar-\nrot and Sauvagnat ( 2016 ), Boehm, Flaaen, and Pandalai-Nayar ( 2019 ), Ander-\nson, Du, and Schlusche ( 2019 ), Braggion, Manconi, and Zhu ( 2020 ), Carvalho\net al. ( 2021 )). We contribute to this literature by providing a broadly applica-\nble text-based methodology for capturing the transmission of a wide range of\nlarge shocks that \ufb02exibly accounts for important cross-\ufb01rm dependencies that\ninclude, but are not limited to, customer-supplier or lender-borrower relation-\nships.\nA large and growing body of work argues that variation in uncertainty\naffects asset prices, international capital \ufb02ows, investment, employment\n 15406261, 2024, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.13293 by Test, Wiley Online Library on [08/05/2024].

Measuring Firm-Level Brexit Exposure, Risk, and Sentiment\nTo create a time-varying measure of a \ufb01rm\u2019s Brexit exposure , we parse\nthe \ufb01rm\u2019s earnings call transcripts and count the number of times the word\n\u201cBrexit\u201d is used.8We then divide this number by the total number of words in\nthe transcript to account for differences in transcript length,\nBrexitExposure i,t=1\nBi,tBi,t/summationdisplay\nb=11[b=Brexit ], (1)\n6Alternatively, we could have used \ufb01rms\u2019 annual reports (SEC Form 10-K) as a text source (see,\ne.g., Campello et al. ( 2020 )). We decided against using annual reports as a text source because\ndoing so would have limited our investigation to the impact of Brexit on U.S.-listed \ufb01rms only,\nrather than on the global sample of international \ufb01rms that we are interested in.\n7About 3.5% of the transcripts in our sample indicate that they contain content that has been\ntranslated into English. These translations could be problematic for our analysis if, for linguistic\nreasons, translated discussions of Brexit were systematically more positively or negatively toned\nthan the original. We examine this possibility in Table IA.II in the Internet Appendix ,w h e r ew e\ncompare translated and nontranslated earnings calls held by \ufb01rms headquartered in the same\ncountry (column (2)). Subject to our standard vector of controls, we \ufb01nd no signi\ufb01cant differences\nin either Brexit sentiment or Brexit risk. Moreover, removing these translated transcripts from\nour analysis has no perceptible effects on our main results.\n8Google Trends shows the \ufb01rst use of the term \u201cBrexit\u201d in October 2012. Its usage increased in\nJanuary 2016 and peaked in June 2016. \u201cBr ixit\u201d was proposed as an alternative term but did not\nhave meaningful volume on Google Trends in the sample period.\n 15406261, 2024, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.13293 by Test, Wiley Online Library on [08/05/2024].

For example,\na French exporter may worry about future tariffs on her U.K.-bound exports\nand expect her business to be less pro\ufb01table (lower conditional mean) in addi-\ntion to having higher variance (the tariffs may or may not materialize). Thus,\nteasing out the effects of Brexit-related uncertainty on a \ufb01rm\u2019s actions also\nrequires controlling for Brexit\u2019s impact on the conditional mean of the \ufb01rm\u2019s\nfuture earnings.\nTo separate such \ufb01rst- and second-moment impacts, we next construct mea-\nsures of Brexit risk and sentiment by conditioning our word counts on proxim-\nity to synonyms for risk or uncertainty and positive- and negative-tone words,\nrespectively. Following the procedure in Hassan et al. ( 2019 ), we de\ufb01ne\nBrexitRisk i,t=1\nBi,tBi,t/summationdisplay\nb=1/braceleftbig\n1[b=Brexit ]\u00d71[|b\u2212r|<10]/bracerightbig\n,\nwhere ris the position of the nearest synonym of risk or uncertainty. To capture\nrisks associated with Brexit, we count mentions of \u201cBrexit\u201d that occur within a\n10-word neighborhood of a synonym for \u201crisk\u201d or \u201cuncertainty\u201d from the Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary .10To aid interpretation, we standardize BrexitRisk by the\naverage BrexitRisk for U.K.-headquartered \ufb01rms as measured in the period\nafter 2015. A value of one thus denotes the average Brexit risk of U.K. \ufb01rms\nbetween 2016 and 2019.\nTo determine whether Brexit is good or bad news for a \ufb01rm (i.e., its \ufb01rst-\nmoment impact), we follow the same procedure but now condition on proxim-\nity to positive- and negative-tone words, as obtained from the Loughran and\nMcDonald ( 2011 ) sentiment dictionary11:\nBrexitSentiment i,t=1\nBi,tBi,t/summationdisplay\nb=1\u23a7\n\u23a8\n\u23a9{1[b=Brexit ]\u00d7\u239b\n\u239db+10/summationdisplay\nc=b\u221210S(c)\u239e\n\u23a0\u23ab\n\u23ac\n\u23ad,\n9This procedure can be easily modi\ufb01ed to obtain counts of variations on Brexit (e.g., \u201chard\u201d or\n\u201csoft\u201d Brexit) and of other phrases that have become meaningful in the aftermath of the Brexit\nreferendum (e.g., \u201cno deal\u201d or \u201cWTO terms\u201d).\n10Table IA.III in the Internet Appendix provides a list of these synonyms. We exclude \u201cquestion\u201d\nand \u201cquestions\u201d from this list as call moderators often ask for the \u201cnext question\u201d.\n11Among all of the synonyms for risk or uncertainty used in our sample of earnings con-\nference calls, 13 risk synonyms also have a negative connotation (rather than simply indicat-\ning the existence of risk). These synonyms include \u201chazardous,\u201d \u201cerratic,\u201d \u201cdanger,\u201d \u201cdangerous,\u201d\n\u201crisky,\u201d \u201cdoubt,\u201d and \u201cfear.\u201d Our measures thus explicitly allow speakers to simultaneously con-\nvey the existence of risk and negative sentiment. Empirically, when we include both BrexitRisk\nandBrexitSentiment in a regression, any variation that is common to both of these variables (as\na result of overlapping words) is not used to estimate parameters of interest. Thus, in principle,\noverlap does not interfere with our ability to disentangle BrexitRisk from BrexitSentiment .\n 15406261, 2024, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.13293 by Test, Wiley Online Library on [08/05/2024].

We \ufb01rst show that \ufb01rms\u2019 BrexitExposure is signi\ufb01cantly correlated with\nobservable business links to the United Kingdom. We then consider the con-\nstituent parts of BrexitExposure separately, describing (in detail) the patterns\nof both BrexitRisk andBrexitSentiment over time and across countries. Finally,\nto further validate our method, we present the results from an extensive hu-\nman reading of text fragments (\u201csnippets\u201d) in which Brexit is mentioned to\ndetermine the content of the associated discussions.\nA.1.

Non-U.K. \ufb01rms\u2019 BrexitRisk peaks immediately after the referen-\ndum at about 0.4. U.K. \ufb01rms have a similar peak, with average BrexitRisk\nreaching about one following the referendum.16Thus, immediately after the\nreferendum, Brexit risk for international \ufb01rms reaches almost half the level of\nthe average U.K. \ufb01rm\u2019s Brexit risk in the 2016 to 2019 period. While BrexitRisk\nsubsides in 2017, it rises sharply in the second half of 2018, nearly reaching\ntwo for U.K. \ufb01rms and about 0.5 for non-U.K. \ufb01rms. This time-series pattern\nclosely mimics the negotiation process between the EU and the United King-\ndom, particularly at the end of 2018, when the speci\ufb01cs of the deal reached\nbetween Theresa May\u2019s government and the EU became increasingly clear, as\ndid the dif\ufb01culties of obtaining parliamentary approval for that deal. In 2019,\nthe prospect of the United Kingdom leaving the EU without a deal (and resort-\ning back to World Trade Organization [WTO] trade terms) became more likely,\nwith uncertainty about Brexit remaining high through the end of our sample\nperiod.17\nFigure 2shows the average BrexitRisk by \ufb01rm-headquarters country for all\ncountries with nonzero BrexitRisk and a minimum of \ufb01ve headquartered \ufb01rms.\n(Countries with zero country-level BrexitRisk include those far from the United\nKingdom, such as Thailand, Nigeria, and Argentina, and some nearer coun-\ntries for which we have relatively low coverage: Portugal [nine \ufb01rms] and the\nCzech Republic [six \ufb01rms].)\nCountry-level values are calculated by taking the mean BrexitRisk for all\n\ufb01rms headquartered in a given country and computing each \ufb01rm\u2019s average\nBrexitRisk using all available post-2015 observations. By construction, the\nU.K. country-level BrexitRisk in this period equals unity. Perhaps the most\nimmediate takeaway from this \ufb01gure is the position of Ireland with a country-\nlevel Brexit risk of 1.74, far greater than the Brexit risk of the average U.K.\n\ufb01rm.18(This difference is statistically signi\ufb01cant; standard errors are reported\nin Table IA.VI in the Internet Appendix .) Further, geographical proximity to\nthe U.K. matters: other high-scoring countries include nearby Denmark, the\nNetherlands, France, and Belgium (all EU member states). Non-EU countries\n16Fisman and Zitzewitz ( 2019 ) show a similar (aggregate) pattern for the period between July\nand December 2016 using their (stock returns-based) Brexit Long-Short Index.\n17Bloom et al. ( 2019 ) report a measure of Brexit uncertainty based on a survey question in\nthe Decision Maker Panel, which asks whether Brexit is a top-three driver of uncertainty. The\ncorrelation between BrexitRisk and this alternative Brexit uncertainty measure, available for U.K.\n\ufb01rms only, is positive and statistically signi\ufb01cant.\n18Interestingly, this \ufb01nding mirrors the result in Garetto, Oldenski, and Ramondo ( 2019 ), who\nquantify the total welfare effect of Brexit on EU economies. They \ufb01nd that the Brexit shock most\nreduces purchasing power (i.e., real income) in Ireland. More generally, the literature on geography\nand trade argues that market and supplier access to neighboring countries is most important for\nsmall economies (Redding and Venables ( 2004 )).\n 15406261, 2024, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.13293 by Test, Wiley Online Library on [08/05/2024].

U.S. exposure also appears to be disproportionately\nhigh: BrexitRisk of the average U.S. \ufb01rm is 0.13, that is, 13% of the average\nU.K \ufb01rm and similar to the average Greek \ufb01rm.\nIn Figure IA.1 in the Internet Appendix , we plot the mean BrexitRisk by in-\ndustry for both U.K.- and non\u2013U.K.-headquartered \ufb01rms. The mean industry\nBrexitRisk is computed by averaging all \ufb01rms in a particular industry. In al-\nmost all industries (Health Services is an exception), the mean BrexitRisk is\nsigni\ufb01cantly larger in the United Kingdom than in non-U.K. countries. The dif-\nference between the United Kingdom and the rest of the world is particularly\nprominent in the Services and Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate industries.\nFinally, we review excerpts of earnings calls discussing Brexit and its asso-\nciated risks. Table IIreports excerpts with the highest BrexitRisk among \ufb01rms\nwith the highest \ufb01rm-level average BrexitRisk . In Panel A, these excerpts are\ntaken from U.K. companies such as Bellway, Millennium & Copthorne Hotels,\nand Endava.

In all cases, we \ufb01nd that the\ndiscussion centers on Brexit-related uncertainty faced by the \ufb01rm in question.\nFor example, in October 2018, management of the Swedish \ufb01rm Sweco claimed\nthat \u201cthere is still an uncertainty when it comes to Brexit and some weakness\nin the real estate market.\u201d Similarly, during their April 2019 earnings call,\nmanagement of Arjo AB, also headquartered in Sweden, stated that \u201cthe en-\ntire decline in the quarter came from U.K. where Brexit uncertainty in the last\nquarter ....\u201d\nA.3.

We observe a sharp decrease in sentiment immediately after\nthe Brexit referendum (a phenomenon more pronounced for U.K. \ufb01rms than\ninternational \ufb01rms), with sentiment scores reverting to slightly below zero for\nmost of 2017.

We also recorded how dif\ufb01cult (easy, medium, hard) the\nauditors found classifying a given fragment and asked auditors to separately\n\ufb02ag fragments in which call participants mention that Brexit has limited or no\nimpact on the \ufb01rm. Each auditor was assigned 265 fragments, and thus 20%\nof fragments were assigned to two auditors. Ex post, we \ufb01nd that the auditors\nagreed on the classi\ufb01cations 77% of the time.22For our main content analysis\n(discussed next), we exclude all fragments that at least one auditor indicated\nwere hard to classify.\nThe following stylized facts emerge from this human audit. In 59.8% of all\ntext fragments mentioning Brexit risk, auditors found that call participants\nwere discussing at least one of our eight prespeci\ufb01ed topics (3.8% of fragments\nmention two or more). In the remaining 40.2% of fragments, BrexitRisk is dis-\ncussed without specifying a distinct concern, suggesting that in these cases call\nparticipants cannot give much color to the speci\ufb01c risk faced by the \ufb01rm. In the\nU.K. subsample, this \u201cunspeci\ufb01c\u201d risk category is initially particularly high\n(51.9% in 2016) and then drops monotonically to 31.9% in 2019, as concerns\nabout Brexit became markedly more speci\ufb01c (see Figure IA.2 in the Internet\nAppendix ).\nPanel A of Figure 4presents the share of each prespeci\ufb01ed topic in Brexit-\nrisk discussions. This \ufb01gure presents topic categories on the vertical axis, while\nthe horizontal axis corresponds to a given topic\u2019s share across all speci\ufb01c top-\nics when the \ufb01rm discusses BrexitRisk . To illustrate, Consumer con\ufb01dence, de-\nmand is mentioned in about 30% of BrexitRisk snippets. Other high-ranking\nBrexit risk topics include uncertainty related to logistics and transition costs\n(14.6%), FX (12.1%), other asset prices (10.5%), trade deals (7.4%), and legal or\nregulatory issues (5.4%).23\nPanel B of Figure 4shows the time-variation in these speci\ufb01c concerns driv-\ningBrexitRisk . We see more pronounced Brexit risks related to asset prices\nand exchange rates early in the sample. Many of these conversations centered\non the value of the British pound, which exhibited substantial volatility follow-\ning the Brexit vote. Later, when details about the conditions under which the\nUnited Kingdom would leave the EU became clearer, the proportion of Brexit-\nrisk discussions related to logistics and transition costs, particularly those\nrelated to supply disruptions, rose markedly. We also observe a rise in con-\ncerns related to trade deals and negotiations after it became clear that the\nUnited Kingdom would not remain in the single market.\nIn addition to decomposing BrexitRisk into these prespeci\ufb01ed topics, it is\ninstructive to understand the degree to which each topic is associated with risk.\n21The audit guide is available at our website www.\ufb01rmlevelrisk.com .\n22For comparison, in their study on human sentiment classi\ufb01cation, Bobicev and Sokolova\n(2017 ) \ufb01nd average interauditor agreement of 79.6%.\n23In Figure IA.3 in the Internet Appendix we \ufb01nd that this pattern is similar when we consider\nBrexitExposure rather than BrexitRisk , that is, when we analyze speci\ufb01c topics for text fragments\ncontaining the word \u201cBrexit\u201d without conditioning on synonyms for risk or uncertainty.\n 15406261, 2024, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.13293 by Test, Wiley Online Library on [08/05/2024].

The key takeaway from this \ufb01gure is that referencing each of our eight\nprespeci\ufb01ed topics is associated with signi\ufb01cant increase in risk. At the higher\nend, a reference to Brexit in relation to Trade deals andConsumer con\ufb01dence,\ndemand is accompanied, on average, by 0.80 and 0.73 risk synonyms, respec-\ntively. At the lower end, references to Brexit in discussions on the labor market\nand FX concerns increase the frequency of risk synonyms by 0.46 and 0.47, re-\nspectively. Brexit references with no speci\ufb01c topic or a topic outside our eight\ncategories are accompanied, on average, by 0.68 ( SE=0.02) risk synonyms.24\nIn contrast, statements to the effect that Brexit has limited or no impact on\nthe \ufb01rm reduce, on average, the incidence of risk synonyms by merely 0.13\n(SE=0.04). In Figure IA.4 (Panel A) in the Internet Appendix , we partition\nthese estimates into U.K. and non-U.K. \ufb01rms. We \ufb01nd that, compared with\ninternational \ufb01rms, U.K. \ufb01rms use signi\ufb01cantly more risk synonyms in their\ndiscussions of Brexit\u2019s relation to consumer con\ufb01dence and demand, logistics\nand transition costs, and asset prices. However, these differences are gener-\nally relatively small (on average 0.2 to 0.3 additional risk synonyms). Based\non this analysis, we conclude that Brexit signi\ufb01cantly increases uncertainty\nat the \ufb01rm level through a broad range of both speci\ufb01c and unspeci\ufb01c antici-\npated impacts.\nTurning to a \ufb01rm\u2019s sentiment with respect to each Brexit topic, we calculate\nthe Brexit sentiment for each Brexit-related text fragment and project it on\nthe array of indicator variables in equation ( 2). Panel B of Figure 5shows a\nfew striking results. First, almost all fragments discussing speci\ufb01c Brexit top-\nics have, on average, a signi\ufb01cantly negative tone. We observe the strongest\nnegative sentiment for legal and regulatory issues ( \u22120.78 more negative- than\npositive-tone words, on average), followed by FX and asset prices ( \u22120.77 and\n\u22120.53, respectively), and discussions relating to the labor market and employ-\nment ( \u22120.51). Similarly, references to other and unspeci\ufb01c topics related to\nBrexit have \u22120.31 ( SE=0.06) more negative- than positive-tone words. No-\ntably, the only prespeci\ufb01ed topic category with a positive (though not statisti-\ncally signi\ufb01cant) point estimate is government expenditures (0.37, SE=0.35).\n24Indeed, these differences are not statistically distinguishable from zero.\n 15406261, 2024, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.13293 by Test, Wiley Online Library on [08/05/2024].

        "extracted_text": "The Global Impact of Brexit Uncertainty 435\nThus, Brexit-related discussions are only signi\ufb01cantly positive when \ufb01rms in-\ndicate that Brexit has little to no impact on their business (1.17, SE=0.13). In-\nterestingly, this negative pattern also prevails in our subsample of U.K.-based\n\ufb01rms, where results are broadly similar (see Panel B of Figure IA.4). Specif-\nically, U.K.-based \ufb01rms have (marginally) less negative discussions related to\nregulatory issues but signi\ufb01cantly more negative discussions about Brexit\u2019s re-\nlation to government expenditures. There are no other systematic differences\nin sentiment between these two groups of \ufb01rms.\nIt is informative to compare these \ufb01ndings with the pronouncements of the\nVote Leave campaign in the debate preceding the Brexit referendum in the\nUnited Kingdom. One of the boldest claims was that negotiating with the EU\nwould result in \u201cthe easiest trade deal in human history,\u201d according to British\nSecretary of State for International Trade, Dr. Liam Fox. Then Lord Chan-\ncellor Michael Gove stated that he foresaw \u201ca free trade area stretching from\nIceland to Turkey.\u201d25Other prominent reasons given for leaving the EU were\nincreased government expenditures and being freed from EU regulation. Re-\nmarkably, none of the touted bene\ufb01ts of the Vote Leave campaign are re\ufb02ected\nin the sentiment U.K. \ufb01rms express about these various topics. On the contrary,\non average U.K. \ufb01rms consider leaving the EU bad news for each dimension\nwe consider.\nIV. Event Study: Asset Pricing Effects of Brexit\nIn this section, we consider the implications of the June 23, 2016 referendum\nto leave the EU on the market valuation of U.K., U.S., and international \ufb01rms.\nThe outcome of the referendum vote surprised most observers (Fisman and\nZitzewitz ( 2019 )), as polling in the preceding months had persistently shown a\n\u201cRemain\u201d victory (Born et al. ( 2019 )). Famously, Boris Johnson, one of the lead-\ning \ufb01gures of the Vote Leave campaign, went to bed resigned to losing the vote,\nonly to wake up to the sound of demonstrators protesting the vote\u2019s outcome at\nhis private residence.26The surprise outcome creates favorable conditions for\nan event study assessing the asset pricing effects of the Brexit referendum.\nWhen investors learned about the referendum\u2019s outcome, they formed new\nexpectations about publicly listed \ufb01rms\u2019 prospects. Event-period stock price\nchanges should thus re\ufb02ect changes in investors\u2019 expectations about the di-\nrect and indirect consequences of Brexit for international \ufb01rms (Hill, Korczak,\nand Korczak ( 2019 ), Davies and Studnicka ( 2018 )). Correlating the market\u2019s\nassessment with our measures of Brexit exposure, risk, and sentiment also\nvalidates our methodology.\n25Both quotes are reported in https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/09/uk/brexit-promises-gbr-intl/\nindex.html .\n26See ITV report on June 24, 2016.\n 15406261, 2024, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.13293 by Test, Wiley Online Library on [08/05/2024].

Columns (4) to (8) provide summary statistics for\nthe subsamples of U.K., international (i.e., non-U.K.), and U.S. \ufb01rms. The key\nvariables of interest are our Brexit exposure, risk, and sentiment measures.\nFor the purpose of this analysis, we consider both \u201caverage Brexit\u201d (denoted\nby an overline) and \u201cpre-Brexit\u201d exposure, risk, and sentiment variables. The\n\ufb01rst group of variables is computed by averaging all available Brexit variable\nscores from 2016 to 2019, while pre-Brexit variables are calculated based on\nthe sample of earnings conference calls held before June 23, 2016, the date of\nthe Brexit referendum.\nAs can be seen, Brexit exposure, risk, and sentiment are larger in abso-\nlute value in the United Kingdom than internationally, regardless of whether\nthey are calculated before or after the Brexit vote. For example, the mean\nBrexitRisk ifor the full sample is 0.232, while for the U.K. sample the cor-\nresponding value is equal to one (by construction). Brexit-related sentiment\nacross our sample is, on average, negative. The median values of Brexit-related\nvariables are zero, consistent with analysts and senior management discussing\nBrexit only when they expect the \ufb01rm to be impacted. Event-window stock re-\nturns are calculated using a window of four trading days starting on June 24,\n2016 and ending on June 29, 2016 (since the referendum took place on a Thurs-\nday).\nB.

We \ufb01nd a negative relation in both panels (although\nthe slope coef\ufb01cient is more negative for the U.K. sample), implying that the\n28Interestingly, we also see a slight uptick (though not statistically distinguishable from zero)\nin the valuation of high\u2013Brexit-risk \ufb01rms in the week before the referendum, when the \u201cRemain\u201d\ncampaign was making large gains in the polls, consistent with the analysis of polling averages in\nHill, Korczak, and Korczak ( 2019 ).\n29The event-study framework also lends itself to examining the sensitivity of our method to\nthe choice of measurement window when constructing conditional measures such as BrexitRisk\nand BrexitSentiment . Recall that a reference to Brexit only counts toward the BrexitRisk\n(BrexitSentiment ) score if, in a 10-word neighborhood, a risk (sentiment) synonym is present. We\nrepeat the event-study analysis reported in Panel B of Table IV(i.e., using the U.S. sample) and\nvary the width of the text window (i.e., number of words) around \u201cBrexit.\u201d We start with a window\nof \ufb01ve words and report increments of \ufb01ve words until the window is extended to 25 words. We\nalso consider a text window of three sentences (or \u201ctriples\u201d), where the middle sentence contains\nthe word \u201cBrexit.\u201d We report our \ufb01ndings in Table IA.IX in the Internet Appendix . In summary,\nthe estimated coef\ufb01cient on BrexitRisk does not vary much across different text windows. At the\nsame time, however, the coef\ufb01cient on BrexitSentiment attenuates as the text window widens, to\nthe point that we lose signi\ufb01cance when measured using a sentence triple. We conclude that Brexit\nrisk can be measured by a longer or shorter text window without affecting inferences. For Brexit\nsentiment, in contrast, extending the text window beyond 10 words introduces more noise. This\npattern likely emerges because tone words are used about three times more frequently than syn-\nonyms for risk, so longer text windows are more likely to pick up tone words related to non-Brexit\nissues discussed in the surrounding text.\n 15406261, 2024, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.13293 by Test, Wiley Online Library on [08/05/2024].

One implication of this \ufb01nd-\ning is that conventional event studies cannot sharply distinguish winners and\nlosers (i.e., \ufb01rst-moment exposure) from those affected by risks (i.e., second-\nmoment exposure) related to the Brexit shock because both sentiment and\nrisk potentially affect stock prices. In contrast, our two text-based measures,\nBrexitSentiment andBrexitRisk , enable researchers to disentangle the two ex-\nposures. Moreover, in the next section, we show that our text-based classi\ufb01ca-\ntion approach also persuasively separates Brexit risk and sentiment from risk\nand sentiment deriving from other, non\u2013Brexit-related sources. This feature\nis particularly helpful when studying \ufb01rm-speci\ufb01c responses to Brexit, as we\ndiscuss more in the next section.\nV. Firm-Level Effects of Brexit\nTwo substantive facts emerge from the empirical \ufb01ndings in the previous\nsections. First, \ufb01rms are exposed to the shock caused by the Brexit referen-\ndum, not just in the United Kingdom but globally. Even though the shock is\nperhaps strongest in the (nearby) EU countries, it extends as far as the United\nStates, Singapore, and South Africa. Second, equity markets quickly impound\nthe \ufb01rst- and second-moment implications into stock prices. In a four-day\nreturn window around the 2016 referendum, \ufb01rms with high average Brexit\nrisk lose value, while \ufb01rms with more positive Brexit sentiment increase in\nstock value. While these \ufb01ndings are consistent with the forward-looking\nnature of equity markets, they also leave open the question of the precise\nway in which individual \ufb01rms respond to the Brexit shock.

Firm-level outcome variables are measured yearly from 2011 to 2019.\nDescriptive statistics for all \ufb01rm-level variables are presented in Table III.\nInferences are based on standard errors clustered at the \ufb01rm level.\nBefore discussing the results of this analysis, we note that it is well recog-\nnized, in both theoretical and empirical work, that uncertainty can directly\nin\ufb02uence \ufb01rm-level investment and employment (Pindyck ( 1988 ), Bernanke\n(1983 ), Dixit and Pindyck ( 1994 ), Bloom, Bond, and Van Reenen ( 2007 ),\nGilchrist, Sim, and Zakraj\u0161ek ( 2014 )).30Recent developments in the literature\nshow that \ufb01rst- and second-moment shocks can appear together, either ampli-\nfying or confounding each other (Bloom et al. ( 2018 ), Berger, Dew-Becker, and\nGiglio ( 2020 )). We examine these predictions in the context of Brexit, leverag-\ning the fact that our text-based approach allows us to separate the two.31\nFigure 7shows a binned scatter plot of the relation between \ufb01rm-level cap-\nital investment ( Ii,t+1/Ki,t)a n d BrexitRisk i,t, controlling for BrexitSentiment i,t,\nlog(assets ), and sector and time \ufb01xed effects. The red (blue) line represents\nthe estimated slope for the sample of U.K. (non-U.K.) \ufb01rms. In both panels,\nBrexitRisk i,tis negatively and signi\ufb01cantly associated with the capital invest-\nment rate. In fact, the estimated coef\ufb01cients are very similar in magnitude:\n\u22120.583 ( SE=0.249) for the U.K. and \u22120.614 ( SE=0.150) for the non-U.K.\nsample. The latter coef\ufb01cient implies that for each year after 2016, an interna-\ntional \ufb01rm with a BrexitRisk equal to that of the average U.K. \ufb01rm experienced\na 0.614 percentage point decrease in its investment rate relative to an unex-\nposed \ufb01rm. This effect corresponds to a 2.5% drop relative to the mean (24.5)\n30In macroeconomic models, an increase in aggregate risk may increase or decrease aggregate\ninvestment due to general equilibrium effects on the interest rate (see, e.g., Fern\u00e1ndez-Villaverde\net al. ( 2015 ), Hassan and Mertens ( 2017 )). However, this ambiguity does not usually exist in the\ncross-section of \ufb01rms. In models with adjustment costs, a \ufb01rm facing a relative increase in \ufb01rm-\nlevel risk should always decrease its investment compared to other \ufb01rms.\n31Bloom et al. ( 2019 ) points out that Brexit presents a persistent uncertainty shock that should\nhave a heterogeneous impact on U.K. \ufb01rms; the impact depends on \ufb01rms\u2019 prior exposure to the\nEU. Moving beyond the impact on U.K. \ufb01rms, we can also estimate the effects of this uncertainty\nshock on non-U.K. \ufb01rms or on U.S. \ufb01rms speci\ufb01cally. We further show that Brexit is not merely an\nuncertainty shock but also has \ufb01rst-moment implications.\n 15406261, 2024, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.13293 by Test, Wiley Online Library on [08/05/2024].

Our estimates for\nU.S. \ufb01rms are larger than for the full sample, potentially because \ufb01rm-level\nvariables are measured with less error in this more homogeneous subsample.\nGiven an average BrexitRisk i,tamong U.S.-headquartered \ufb01rms of 0.128, our\npreferred estimate in column (6) ( \u22120.793, SE=0.258) suggests that Brexit\nrisk accounts for a 0 .128\u00d70.793=0.10 percentage point decrease in the in-\nvestment rate of the average U.S.-based \ufb01rm in each year after 2016.\nThe \ufb01ndings reported in Table Vare based on regressions that constrain\nthe association between BrexitRisk i,tand the investment rate to be time-\ninvariant. To analyze whether the effect of Brexit-related uncertainty is indeed\nconstant, versus time-varying, we estimate a regression of Ii,t+1/Ki,ton inter-\nactions of postreferendum year indicator variables and BrexitRisk , our stan-\ndard set of controls, and country-time and industry-time \ufb01xed effects. Figure 8\npresents the results. (Table IA.XII in the Internet Appendix provides details\nand shows similar results for employment as an alternative outcome variable.)\nThe \ufb01gure shows the strongest marginal effect for a given level of BrexitRisk in\nthe year immediately after the referendum vote (2017). The effect is somewhat\nweaker in the following year and then dissipates. This pattern is consistent\nwith reactions to uncertainty tied to a single future event: international, non-\nU.K. \ufb01rms likely have a limited number of investment projects vulnerable to\nBrexit. After the referendum, \ufb01rms respond by postponing these investments,\nresulting in a level difference in the stock of investments that persists through\nthe end of our sample period.\nDespite the comprehensive set of controls included in Table V, a causal inter-\npretation of the results is subject to three concerns. First, corporate executives\nmight use Brexit risk as an excuse to justify bad performance, even if their\n\ufb01rm is not really exposed to the shock. The correlation between our BrexitRisk\nmeasure and the decline in \ufb01rm investment might then be spurious, picking\nup \u201ccheap talk\u201d about Brexit. However, we have already seen that introduc-\ning controls for the \ufb01rm\u2019s Brexit and overall (i.e., nonBrexit related) sentiment\nhas no perceptible effects on our coef\ufb01cient of interest (compare columns (5)\nand (6) of Table V). Of course, our proxies for sentiment may not fully cap-\nture pertinent \ufb01rst-moment effects. We therefore add additional controls for\nthe \ufb01rm\u2019s recent \ufb01nancial performance in columns (1) to (3) of Table VI. These\nthree columns and all remaining speci\ufb01cations in this table include all controls\nfrom our most demanding speci\ufb01cation in column (7) of Table V. For brevity,\nwe report only the coef\ufb01cients on Brexit risk and the newly added controls.\nColumn (1) adds a measure for the \ufb01rm\u2019s earnings surprise (Ball and Bartov\nsample but reduces the estimated coef\ufb01cient for U.S. \ufb01rms by about 50%, although it remains\nstatistically signi\ufb01cant at the 5% level.\n 15406261, 2024, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.13293 by Test, Wiley Online Library on [08/05/2024].

Again, controlling for non\u2013Brexit-\nrelated risk and realized volatility has no perceptible effect on our estimates\n(compare Table V), demonstrating that the reduction in investment that we\ndocument is speci\ufb01c to Brexit-related risk. Furthermore, column (4) of Table VI\nalso controls for the \ufb01rm\u2019s exposure to trade policy risk ( PRiskTrade i,t). This\nvariable, developed in Hassan et al. ( 2019 ), is constructed in the same way as\nBrexitRisk but differs in that it counts synonyms of risk or uncertainty near\nwords that indicate discussion of political interference in trade policy.34As ex-\npected, we \ufb01nd that exposure to trade-policy risk lowers the \ufb01rm\u2019s investment\nrate: a one-standard-deviation increase in PRiskTrade i,tis associated with a\n0.480 ( SE=0.225) percentage point decrease in the \ufb01rm\u2019s investment rate.\nHowever, including this control has little effect on our coef\ufb01cient of interest,\nwhich remains stable at \u22120.498 ( SE=0.153).\nThe third potential concern is that U.K.-exposed international \ufb01rms may be\nsystematically different and may generally invest less than other \ufb01rms. To ad-\ndress this concern, column (5) adds a \ufb01rm\u2019s average sales in the United King-\ndom before the Brexit referendum as a control variable. Column (6) adds the\n\ufb01rm-speci\ufb01c average of our measure of Brexit exposure, BrexitExposure i, cal-\nculated using all observations of a given \ufb01rm in the sample. Similarly, column\n(7) adds the \ufb01rm\u2019s market response to the Brexit vote (i.e., the \u201cevent-study\nreturns\u201d from Table IV) as an alternative cross-sectional measure of Brexit\nexposure. Note that three of these variables are \u201cbad controls\u201d (Angrist and\nPischke ( 2008 )) since they are potential proxies for Brexit-related risk and/or\nsentiment and hence may inappropriately reduce the explanatory power of\nour variables of interest. That said, they could also be correlated with unob-\nserved differences across \ufb01rms implicated in Brexit, which may, in turn, impact\ninvestment. Adding these variables to our speci\ufb01cation is tantamount to con-\ntrolling for this heterogeneity.35Mindful of the econometric concerns, we \ufb01nd\nlittle evidence that adding these additional controls changes the tenor of our\nmain \ufb01ndings. Neither the pre-Brexit U.K. sales variable nor BrexitExposure i\nor the event-study returns are signi\ufb01cantly associated with \ufb01rms\u2019\ninvestment rates when BrexitRisk i,tand BrexitSentiment i,tare included\nas controls. Furthermore, the magnitude of the estimated coef\ufb01cient on\nBrexitRisk i,tremains stable and highly statistically signi\ufb01cant despite the in-\nclusion of these controls.\n34As one might expect, this measure shows sharp increases coinciding with various trade dis-\nputes between the United States and other countries from 2016 to 2019. See www.\ufb01rmlevelrisk.\ncomfor details.\n35Including \ufb01rm \ufb01xed effects offers an alternative approach to removing (time-invariant) unob-\nserved heterogeneity. We do not have suf\ufb01cient power in most tests to implement this design. For\nthe U.S. sample, however, when adding \ufb01rm \ufb01xed effects to the speci\ufb01cation of column (5) of Table V\n(Panel B), we \ufb01nd a coef\ufb01cient estimate on BrexitRisk i,tequal to \u22120.448 ( SE=0.307), reassuringly\ncomparable to our corresponding estimate for the full sample in Panel A of the same table.\n 15406261, 2024, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.13293 by Test, Wiley Online Library on [08/05/2024].

As for the capital investment rate, we \ufb01nd no\nsigni\ufb01cant association between BrexitSentiment i,tand employment growth,\nagain likely re\ufb02ecting the fact that, before the U.K.\u2019s actual exit from the\nsingle market, Brexit affected \ufb01rm decisions largely by raising uncertainty. As\nbefore, the coef\ufb01cients on NonBrexitRisk andNonBrexitSentiment are statis-\ntically signi\ufb01cant and have the predicted sign. (Table IA.XIII in the Internet\nAppendix reports the same battery of robustness checks as in Table VI.)36\nWe consider sales growth, our third \ufb01rm-level outcome variable, in Panel B.\nWhile we \ufb01nd a negative relation between BrexitRisk i,tand sales growth in\nall sample partitions, the association is no longer statistically signi\ufb01cant. This\n\ufb01nding is consistent with predictions from the real options literature that pos-\ntulate a larger short-run effect of risk on hard-to-reverse investment in phys-\nical and human capital than on short-run sales growth (e.g., Baker, Bloom,\nand Davis ( 2016 )). We also \ufb01nd no signi\ufb01cant evidence of a positive associa-\ntion between BrexitSentiment i,tand sales growth. Instead, sales growth shows\npersistent positive correlations with NonBrexitSentiment , consistent with the\nidea that sales respond more directly to positive and negative shocks only\nafter they are realized. (See Table IA.XIV in the Internet Appendix for ad-\nditional variations and robustness checks.)37\nVI. Regional Support for Brexit\nBefore we conclude, we present a \ufb01nal application for our Brexit exposure\nmeasures, which builds on the simple intuition that voters who live in a region\nwhere the operational headquarters of a \ufb01rm has elevated Brexit exposure\nmay be more likely to vote \u201cRemain\u201d in the referendum. Previous studies gen-\nerally focus on voter characteristics (such as age, ethnicity, and educational\nachievements) to explain geographical variation in voting (e.g., Alabrese et al.\n(2019 ), Fetzer ( 2019 )). We argue that a voter\u2019s referendum choice will also\nbe affected by their assessment of how Brexit will affect local economic and\nemployment conditions. In particular, if local companies \ufb01nd Brexit risky, the\nregional share in support of \u201cLeave\u201d is expected to decrease. We test this pre-\ndiction in Table VIII.\n36Simulations reported in Broadbent et al. ( 2019 ) interpret the Brexit referendum as news\nabout a future slowdown in productivity growth in the U.K.\u2019s tradable sector and predict a reduc-\ntion in investment growth, while employment remains relatively stable.\n37In Table IA.XV in the Internet Appendix , we examine the timing of the effect of Brexit risk\non investment and employment outcome variables. Speci\ufb01cally, we regress both the capital in-\nvestment rate and the employment growth rate onto contemporaneous BrexitRisk i,tand onto one-\nperiod-lagged BrexitRisk i,t\u22121. We \ufb01nd that employment responds more quickly than investment to\nchanges in Brexit risk. Indeed, \ufb01rm hiring responds more to concurrent than to lagged Brexit risk,\nwhile the opposite is true for the investment rate.\n 15406261, 2024, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.13293 by Test, Wiley Online Library on [08/05/2024].

Conclusion\nAssessing the economic impact of speci\ufb01c policy measures, reforms, and\nother market-wide shocks requires quantifying how these events affect the\ncalculations and expectations of decision-makers. In this paper, we develop\na simple and versatile text-based method to measure the costs, bene\ufb01ts, and\nrisks that thousands of decision-makers all around the globe associate with\nspeci\ufb01c shocks. Our method offers several helpful features that address some\nof the challenges identi\ufb01ed in recent research. First, it measures perceptions\ndirectly and in real time without having to conduct expensive large-scale\nsurveys (see, e.g., Arteaga-Garavito et al. ( 2022 ) and Hassan et al. ( 2022 )f o r\napplications in the context of the COVID-19 shock). Second, it meaningfully\ndistinguishes between the perceived risks, costs, and opportunities associated\nwith a given event, thus separating variation in \ufb01rst- and second-moment\neffects of shocks. This is particularly useful in the context of Brexit, where\npolicymakers have long pointed to the potentially detrimental effects of Brexit-\nrelated uncertainty, which we quantify directly. Third, many shocks do not\n(fully) play out in a short period but rather present persistent challenges to\neconomic actors. A method allowing researchers to measure over-time varia-\ntion in a \ufb01rm\u2019s exposure to a persistent shock is particularly valuable in light of\nrecent evidence that the response to a persistent shock might be very different\nfrom the response to a shock that fades away quickly (Bloom et al. ( 2019 )).\nThe 2016 Brexit referendum is an ideal test of our method to assess the\nextent to which the vote\u2019s outcome affected international (i.e., non-U.K.) \ufb01rms.\nOur measures of Brexit exposure, risk, and sentiment behave in economically\nmeaningful ways, strengthening our validity claims. We also document that\n\ufb01rms inside and outside the United Kingdom overwhelmingly view Brexit as\n\u201cbad news.\u201d Further, we report signi\ufb01cant cross-country differences in Brexit\nrisk: Ireland\u2019s Brexit risk is larger even than the U.K.\u2019s, nearby EU countries\nexperience the strongest increase in Brexit-related risk, and Brexit risk also\nhas a material (though weaker) impact in the United States and other non-\nEU countries.\nUsing transcripts of earnings conference calls as the source text provides\nrich context, enabling us to identify \ufb01rms\u2019 concerns about Brexit in detail.\nFrom analyzing the narrative text underlying our measures, we \ufb01nd that even\n39The partial R2of these two variables in column (3) is about 5%.\n 15406261, 2024, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.13293 by Test, Wiley Online Library on [08/05/2024].

Those that see Brexit as bad news, however,\nexpect dif\ufb01culties for their businesses due to regulatory divergence, reduced la-\nbor mobility, decreased trade access, and post-Brexit operational adjustments.\nIn fact, we \ufb01nd that U.S. and international \ufb01rms most exposed to Brexit risk\nhave signi\ufb01cantly reduced investment and employment growth. We also \ufb01nd\nthat equity markets quickly impounded both \ufb01rst- and second-moment expo-\nsures to Brexit: Our Brexit sentiment and risk measures partially explain re-\nturns in equity markets in the days following the referendum.\nTaken together, the evidence suggests that up to the end of our sample period\nin 2019, the Brexit vote mostly acted as an uncertainty shock, leading to signif-\nicant precautionary reductions in investment and employment growth in the\n\ufb01rms and countries most exposed. In addition to this activity-depressing effect\nof sustained uncertainty, equity markets also anticipated large negative \ufb01rst-\nmoment effects from the implementation of Brexit on \ufb01rms around the world,\neffects that have not yet been materialized in corporate actions. Our reading of\nthe evidence suggests that the greater the rupture between the United King-\ndom and the EU, the larger these direct effects (including post-Brexit adjust-\nment costs) will be. As time passes, now that Britain has formally left the EU,\nthe consequences for investment and employment may be larger than those\nassociated with Brexit uncertainty alone.\nBeyond this application to Brexit, Section IIIof the Internet Appendix brie\ufb02y\nshows that our method is suf\ufb01ciently versatile to be more generally useful\nfor characterizing and quantifying \ufb01rm-level exposures to the costs, bene\ufb01ts,\nand risks associated with other shocks, using the 2011 Fukushima nuclear\ndisaster in Japan as an example.
